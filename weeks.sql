(1,1,1,'<p> In group time, we began by setting up weekly team meetings. My group\nseems to be nice, and Anika and I shared one of our big lecture courses\nlast semester. Lionel says he just transferred into this school. The\nproject is pretty big and fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas\nfor the rest of the time. </p>\n\n<p> Anika was pretty quiet &mdash; maybe she suggested an idea or two.\nEveryone else seemed to have a lot to say, though. Natashas ideas almost\nalways made me laugh. She seems to be working hard to get outside the box\nand mostly she did it. This meant that many of her ideas werent really\nuseable, but they were fun and often they helped me to come up with other\nideas, too. Toward the end of our meeting, Lionel noticed that no one was\ntaking notes, so we recounted the ideas we could remember while he wrote\nthem down and we discussed those 14 ideas. </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we crossed off the ones that didnt seem to\nwork (this got rid of most of Natashas) and ultimately narrowed it down to\nsix. I recommended we each look for resources on all the topics to get\nfamiliar with them. Next week, we will report back and select a topic.\nEveryone agreed with this, so we had a plan. </p>\n\n<p> After searching for about half an hour, it was pretty clear that only\ntwo of the topics really work for this project, so I focused on those. I\nfigure that if we are all working on this independently, we are likely to\ncome up with many of the same materials, so I tried not to spend too much\ntime on the ones I found easily, but rather to dig deeper instead. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(2,1,2,'<p> Anika found a lot of materials for one of the topics that I had a rough\ntime with, but Lionel and Natasha also focused on the same two as me. We\nended up with a lot of duplication, but at least we all know those topics.\nWhen we dug into what Anika found for the third topic, I couldnt see how\nwe would be able to use much of it &mdash; the research mostly just had\nmentions of what we needed. Even Anika seemed to mostly dismiss the topic,\nand our discussion quickly centered on our most promising two topics. </p>\n\n<p> There was a lot of discussion about which to choose &mdash; everyone\nhad an opinion. Then Natasha suggested that we try to combine them. We\nwasted about ten minutes trying to see if we could make that work, but\nultimately we couldnt and wound up back where we started. Our first vote\nwas split down the middle, so I decided to make a list of pros and cons. I\nmay have conveniently skewed the list in favor of my preference, but either\nway, our next vote was unanimous. Alex immediately pointed out that the\nother topic, although more exciting on the surface, would have probably\nbeen much more complicated and difficult. </p>\n\n<p> The obvious next step was to find more materials on our selected topic,\nso we figured out the major subtopics and divided them amongst ourselves.\nWe decided everyone would return next week with summaries of what theyd\nfound to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly. To make sure\nwe didnt wind up with a million competing summaries for the many duplicate\nmaterials, I split up the materials wed already got among us. </p>\n\n<p> I found some more materials and then spent about half an hour writing\nthose summaries. The project would be big, but it is pretty straightforward\nso far. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(3,1,3,'<p> During our meeting, we began sorting through the materials. Lionels\nand Natashas materials were in good shape. At one point, Natasha misread\none of Lionels summaries and made everyone laugh, but it was a pretty\nlucky mistake. In the ensuing conversation, a whole new light was shone on\nthe topic. Im not sure if thats what Natasha intended, but if so, it was\nbrilliant.  </p>\n\n<p> I guess I should have spent more time writing because no one understood\nwhat I wrote. Im not used to working in groups, and I guess I forget to\nexplain everything. I just wrote down my observations (which, in this case,\nI could have used to write my own paper), but it wasnt complete and I had\nto explain it for the rest of the group. They did like my observations,\nthough! I told them Id rework them for next week.  </p>\n\n<p> Anikas summaries, on the other hand, were just a sentence or two each.\nInitially, she seemed to think they would be useful to us. After some\nawkward questions, I asked her point blank if shed prefer to use Natashas\nsummaries or her own to write the paper, and she understood. The question\nwas a bit blunt, but if Anika was offended, she didnt show it. I suspect\nit helped that we all had things to do to improve our work for next week.\n</p>\n\n<p> I restructured my summaries this week to look more like summaries than\nmy own notes. When I was done, I asked my roommate to take a look, and he\nhad a few good questions that I subsequently addressed. All told, it took\nme about an hour and forty-five minutes. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(4,1,4,'<p> Lionel was a bit late to the meeting this week, but Anika wasnt there\nat all. She hadnt been in class and no one had heard anything from her, so\nwe werent sure what was going on.  </p>\n\n<p> When it looked like she wouldnt be coming, we began working through my\nupdated materials. Lionel and Natasha were both much happier this time.\nLionel pointed out that they could use some editing, but that they were\nmuch improved. He made a point of saying he really liked some of the\nobservations Id made. He volunteered to try to redo Anikas work and\nassemble what we had for the assignment due next week, but Natasha said\nshed work on Anikas part and get it to him so he could include them. She\nsaid she didnt want him overloaded. She also asked me to put together a\nbasic outline of what the paper should look like. What a smart idea! </p>\n\n<p> Putting together the outline didnt really take a whole lot of time.\n</p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(5,1,5,'<p> Lionel turned in our assignment this week in class and Anika was there,\ntoo. It seems shed had to go home in a rush because her mother went to the\nhospital, but she had done her summaries and got them to Lionel in time for\nhim to include them in what he turned in. Our instructor gave us some time\nto meet as a group at the end of class, and we spent the time looking at my\noutline. Lionel seemed to be satisfied with it, but Anika and Natasha\nwerent. I wasnt really sure what they didnt like because we didnt have\nmuch time to get into it, but I tried to make some changes that evening.\n</p>\n\n<p> At our meeting, it took a while to really understand where we werent\nconnecting. I thought the two of them were looking for me to make some\nchanges to what I had, but it turned out they had completely different\nideas of where this was going &mdash; from each other as well as from me!\nLionel seemed to be confused and stayed out of our discussion. I think he\nfigured it was all a simple misunderstanding thatd get worked out quickly,\nbut he managed to be very involved in the conversation because his face is\nvery expressive. It was clear that he was being swayed by Natasha. So was\nI, for that matter. After about half an hour, we modified the outline to\nlook more like what Natasha was describing. Even Anika reluctantly agreed\nthat it was probably the right way to go. </p>\n\n<p> With the outline settled, Anika suggested we split the outline up into\nquarters and each write one for next week. Lionel spoke up quickly for the\nsecond section and I took the third because I didnt want to write the\nintroduction or the conclusion. Fortunately, Natasha took the former and\nAnika took the latter. </p>\n\n<p> It took me about two hours to write my draft of the paper because I\njust couldnt seem to make everything work properly. I finally stopped when\nI had something, but its hardly my best work. It just doesnt seem to all\nfit properly. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(6,1,6,'<p> It seems that no one was really able to make the pieces work quite\nright, so we had to rethink our approach. I had a feeling Anika would bring\nup her idea from last week, and she did. Fortunately, Id thought a lot\nabout that when I ran into trouble writing and was quickly able to point\nout where and how wed run into the same problems her way. Lionel listened\nfor a bit and then suggested that we try something that he had used on a\npast project; it was a really good idea. It would, of course, require some\nadaptation, but it could work out very well for us.  </p>\n\n<p> Natasha and Anika joined in, and we ironed it out together. It was sort\nof exciting, really. In spite of it being his idea, Lionel seemed to be\nnervous about suggesting anything, but he also contributed. About halfway\ninto our meeting, we started looking back at the pieces wed already\nwritten and seeing if/where they still fit. It looked like we would be left\nwith about half a paper still to write. </p>\n\n<p> This time, we each took pieces that were left to write. Anika and\nNatasha fought a bit over who took one of the tricky parts, but ultimately\nwe all wound up with pieces we could handle. </p>\n\n<p> A few days later, Lionel asked if I could help him out with one of his\npieces. I felt bad because I hadnt started any of my writing, but of\ncourse I said yes. We worked on it for about an hour and he answered all\nhis own questions, so I dont know why he needed me.  </p>\n\n<p> When we moved on to my work, he couldnt understand any of what Id\nthrown together that morning. I knew it needed work, but it was also nice\nto have him pointing out exactly where. Sometimes its tough to see what\nyoure thinking through other peoples eyes. I am pretty sure he helped me\nmore than I helped him, and I told him so, but he probably didnt believe\nme &mdash; he really doesnt think hes very smart. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(7,1,7,'<p> I was a bit late because one of my instructors offered to run a study\nsession to prepare for the midterms, and I desperately needed the help. I\nfelt bad that I forgot to tell the group last week, but when I arrived I\nlearned that everyone else had been late for similar reasons. </p>\n\n<p> In spite of this, everyone was happier with what we had this week and,\nafter running through what we had, the paper was starting to look pretty\ngood. We spent much of our time assembling the pieces into a single paper.\nWhen we did, we realized that neither the introduction nor the conclusion\nworked very well any longer. Natasha asked Lionel to write the\nintroduction, because the new structure of the paper was his idea, but I\nthink he honestly doesnt understand that it was true. He actually denied\nit &mdash; and I dont think it was because he didnt want to write the\npiece. When he said hed do it, he made Anika promise that shed review it\nthe following week.  </p>\n\n<p> I volunteered to rework the conclusion, but Natasha asked me instead to\nproofread and format the document, while she rewrote the conclusion. Anika\ndidnt have anything for the week, and I think she didnt want to feel like\na slacker, so she said shed proofread the document, as well &mdash; just\nto have an extra set of eyes on it.  </p>\n\n<p> Natasha also told us shed be late next week because one of her\nmidterms would run until the start of this meeting. </p>\n\n<p> Proofreading took me awhile. Its a good paper, but you can tell it was\nwritten by four different people. I found lots of little things, but there\nwere a few things that will need major rework. One part of what Natasha had\nwritten probably made sense when she wrote it, but the instructor\ncompletely contradicted it in class, so well have to completely rewrite\nthat piece. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(8,1,8,'<p> I thought the group would be bummed that I was so nitpicky, but they\nwere thrilled Id found so much stuff. Anika found good stuff, too, but I\nhad almost everything she did and then about half again as many. We decided\nthat we couldnt make the bigger changes in time for the draft thats due\nnext week. We will be able to write it, but everyone has tight schedules\nthis week. We cant get it written and give anyone else a chance to take a\nlook at it before we have to turn it in; no one felt that would be OK. </p>\n\n<p> Natasha showed up just as we finished going through the fixes to the\npaper. Next we looked at Lionels introduction and Anika immediately asked\nwhat everyone was thinking: why was it so short? Lionel just shrugged and\nwe all read it. As it turned out, Anika shouldnt have said anything before\nshe read it &mdash; it covered everything it needed to and was pretty good.\nNeither Natasha nor I had any ideas for improving it. I think Anika\nfelt like she had to do something, so after she thought about it for a\nmoment, she agreed that nothing was missing, but said she had some ideas\nfor beefing it up a bit. A few minutes later we had a new version that was\nlonger and felt a bit more complete. It was good, but not really necessary.\nI suggested making a part of what Natasha added a bit more concise. </p>\n\n<p> When we were done, Anika said shed add in the conclusion, make the\nchanges we talked about and have a version of the paper ready to turn in\nnext week in class. Natasha said that shed try to make the larger changes\nthat Id suggested. Lionel volunteered to start building a PowerPoint for\nthe upcoming presentation. I felt bad, but asked if anyone minded if I took\nthe week off because I had to prepare for a late midterm next week in my\ntoughest subject. No one minded. </p>\n\n<p> This week I did nothing for this class outside of our meeting. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(9,1,9,'<p> Anika not only brought a copy of our paper to class for the instructor,\nbut also brought copies for each of us to look at between class and our\nmeeting. This way, we didnt waste our meeting time on reading through it.\nAs an added bonus, Natasha had merged her changes into this latest version.\nUnfortunately, shed had a difficult time making those changes and they\nwere not complete. She brought a list of questions and possible answers,\nand we spent a good twenty minutes on that before we came to any answers.\nAt some point while I was listening, I had a fantastic idea so I said Id\ntake it home and work on it for next week. No one argued with me. </p>\n\n<p> Next we discussed the presentation &mdash; beginning with the\nPowerPoint Lionel had put together. Before Anika could comment (because she\nalways does), Lionel pointed out that this was just a start and that he\nknew there wasnt much to it. He recommended that everyone claim a few\nslides and modify them when they worked on what they were going to say. At\nthis, Anika just shut her mouth and I have to admit, that was pretty\nsatisfying. Shes not mean or anything, but it was nice to not hear her\nbeing critical for once.  </p>\n\n<p> Natasha chose a few slides, including the first one, but Lionel said he\nwanted to introduce us. I was a bit surprised, because I didnt figure hed\nvolunteer for such a visible role. Ultimately, we decided that theyd both\ngive it a shot and see which one we like best when we practice next week.\nIm actually excited about making it into a bit of a competition. </p>\n\n<p> I enjoy public speaking, so I spent a long time iterating over my\ntalking points for our presentation. My roommate is probably sick of\nhearing it, but I feel good about the presentation. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(10,1,10,'<p> I liked my presentation, but Anika and Natasha both had some ideas for\nimprovement. One of Anikas ideas was really a good one, but most of them\nwere sort of picky. Its no big deal, though &mdash; while I dont think\nthe ideas really improve anything, they wont hurt either, so Ill make\nthem.  </p>\n\n<p> Anika and Natasha both presented well, and they took home a lot of\nfeedback, as well. Frankly, Im pretty sure my presentation was better than\neither of theirs. I know that we arent competing against each other and we\nall have to do well, but it felt good to know that mine was good &mdash; no\nmatter what they said. </p>\n\n<p> Lionel on the other hand&hellip; I dont know what was going on there!\nIt looked like this was his first time building a PowerPoint, and he spent\nall his time playing with his new toy! There were animations and images and\nwords flying in and out. Every slide was completely different, too. The\nworst part was that he just read all the words off the slide! Everyone\n&mdash; especially Anika &mdash; had a lot of feedback for him. I think we\nshould have been a bit gentler with him; although hes really bright, he\ndoesnt seem to know it. I could see on his face that took it really hard.\n</p>\n\n<p> Needless to say, it wasnt much of a competition. Natashas\nintroduction was much better than his and we had to go with her for it. I\nthink she might use some of his visual ideas, though &mdash; it looks like\nhe spent a bunch of time cropping our heads for the main slide and it was\npretty nice (if also a bit cheesy). </p>\n\n<p> After the meeting ended and Natasha and Anika left, I offered to work\nwith him and help him with his presentation, but he said no. I think he was\nembarrassed. I hope I didnt make him feel worse. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(11,1,11,'<p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts and we met briefly during\nclass to review it. There werent many comments, and most of them were\npretty minor or issues that Natasha had already fixed. However, there was\none comment that concerned us all: a diagram might help here. I cant\nbelieve that this was the first time I realized that we were presenting our\ninstructor with a great big wall of text_ko:  \ntext_en! How could we have missed that?\nWed definitely have things to talk about at this weeks team meeting. </p>\n\n<p> Lionel arrived a bit late as we were talking about our complete lack of\nimages. However, while we were still at the complaining-about-it stage, he\nwas way ahead of us. He actually apologized as he pulled out a bunch of\nsketches hed \"thrown together.\" They were fantastic! His were done with\npencil on scraps of paper and Natasha copied them over with black pen on\nfull sheets so they were crisper and easier to see. We worked on them for\nabout half an hour, making small changes here and there. Natasha\nvolunteered create new versions to include in the document. </p>\n\n<p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation and\neveryone sounded better this week &mdash; especially Lionel. It was like he\nwas a completely different person. We all commented on the dramatic\nimprovement. Im not sure he quite believed it, but there was some relief\non his face. He was also more active in providing feedback to everyone\nelse. He pointed out that Id included something that wasnt actually in\nour paper. I told him where Id found it and he seemed glad, but not\nsatisfied. He asked if we wanted to talk in the presentation about\nsomething that we didnt mention in the paper. Natasha and Anika didnt\nthink it was a big deal, but he clearly felt like its a bad idea. He\nwouldnt let it go, but he wasnt saying I needed to take it out &mdash; he\nwas asking where we should add it to the paper. I told him that I didnt\nthink it was a big deal and also that I didnt have time to do it. So, he\nsaid that hed add it into the paper himself. Problem solved! </p>\n\n<p> I practiced some more for the presentation, but mostly left this class\nalone because Im pretty sure we are in good shape. However, after giving\nit a lot of thought, I realized that Lionel had a good point. I removed\nthat piece that we spent so much time discussing in the meeting. It\ntightened things up a bit to do so and wasnt really needed. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-08-17 01:23:03',NULL),
(12,1,12,'<p> Lionels images really added a lot to our paper, making it easier for\npeople to understand parts of it. Lionel also claimed one of the images for\none of his slides, and it worked much better than the bullet points hed\nhad on there. I cant believe we didnt have any images in at all until\nnow. </p>\n\n<p> This week, the presentation was much better and after another three\npractice runs, it sounded smooth. Anika managed to slow down quite a lot. I\nthink Lionel was a little bit frustrated to find that, after our argument\nlast week, Id removed the bit he added into the paper. I probably should\nhave told him when I made that decision. Natasha added the photos of us to\nher introduction slide, and they looked pretty good. Finally, and arguably\nmost importantly, we managed to cut it down to the correct time. </p>\n\n<p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a\nmoment here and there. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(13,1,13,'<p> The presentation went OK, but not quite as smoothly as Id hoped. I was\nnervous and I think I didnt speak as loudly as I should have. Im pretty\nsure that most people heard me, but it should have been louder. Anika, on\nthe other hand, raced through her presentation and as a result, I dont\nthink anyone understood her. We wound up finishing up about thirty seconds\nearly.  </p>\n\n<p> Our classmates asked some good questions, which showed that our\npresentation was decent; they understood enough to ask questions. Anika,\nwho spoke last, naturally received all the questions, but she handed them\noff to whomever she felt was best suited to answer them &mdash; that was a\nnice touch. There werent a lot of questions, and none of them came to me.\nWe should have discussed clothes beforehand because Lionel wore slacks and\na sports jacket, and Natasha wore a dress skirt and blouse. Anika and I\nwere dressed very casually, and it was a bit uncomfortable. </p>\n\n<p> Generally, though, I think we felt good about the work wed done. I\nexpect positive feedback and good grades. </p>\n\n<p> We only met briefly this week because we were mostly finished and we\nall had finals to study for, but I said Id go through the paper one more\ntime.

(14,1,14,'<p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready\nfor submission at the end of the week. As we went through it, Anika took\nissue with a few of the changes Id made. The language I used was a bit\nambiguous and it could be read to mean the opposite of what we intended.\nShe was right, but I dont feel badly, because I dont know how she noticed\nit. It took the rest of us a while to see it. Maybe it was because we all\nknow what were trying to say, but once I saw it, I couldnt un-see it.\nWhen I finally did see it, I said Id fix it, but I wasnt really sure that\nI could. Fortunately, Anika saved me. She said she had no problem doing it\n&mdash; as long as everyone trusted her (there wasnt enough time for her\nto make the changes and get us all to say OK in time). Of course we all\ntrusted her and said so. </p>\n\n<p> The night before she sent it in to our instructor, Anika sent us a copy\nof the document to make sure we were all OK with it.

I also asked Alex\nto put together a basic outline of what the paper should look like so we\ncan get started on that. </p>\n\n<p> It took me about an hour to redo Anikas materials and their summaries\nand I got Lionel the materials a day early.

Lionel spoke up quickly for the second section, so\nI grabbed the first part. Anika took the last, and that left the third part\nfor Alex. </p>\n\n<p> I banged my head against this assignment for over an hour before I gave\nup.

It would, of course, require some\nadaptation, but it could work out very well for us.  </p>\n\n<p> Anika and I ironed it out together. In spite of it being his idea,\nLionel seemed to be nervous about suggesting anything, but he did\ncontribute. About halfway into our meeting, we started looking back at the\npieces wed already written to see if/where they still fit. It looked like\nwe would be left with about half a paper still to write. </p>\n\n<p> This time, we each claimed pieces that were left to write. Anika took\none of the bits that Id already started looking at. I told her I wanted to\nwrite that one, but she wouldnt budge. She eventually traded with me for\nanother piece, but not the one Id really wanted. I just went with it\nbecause I didnt want to argue. </p>\n\n<p> I had a lot of writing to do this week, but I also had a lot to do in\nmy other classes, so I spread this out over two nights of about an hour and\na half each.

After running through\nwhat we had, the paper was starting to look pretty good. We spent much of\nour time assembling the pieces into a single paper. When we did, we\nrealized that neither the introduction nor the conclusion worked very well\nany longer. I figured that Lionel should write these, since he had to have\nthe best handle on it. But he responded that it wasnt his idea and that he\nwasnt comfortable with it. This seemed absurd; I reminded him that he was\nthe one who suggested this structure when we were all stuck. Eventually, he\nsaid hed do it but he wanted someone to review it afterward; Anika\nvolunteered.  </p>\n\n<p> Alex volunteered to rewrite the conclusion, but I was afraid his\nwriting wasnt very good, so I asked him instead to proofread and format\nthe document while I rewrote the conclusion.

Neither Alex nor I had any ideas for improving it.  </p>\n\n<p> I think Anika felt like she had to do something.

A few minutes later, we had a new\nversion that was longer and felt a bit meatier. </p>\n\n<p> When we were done, Anika said shed add in the conclusion, make the\nchanges we talked about and have a version of the paper ready to turn in\nnext week in class. I, in turn, volunteered to try to make the larger\nchanges that Alex suggested. Lionel said hed start working on a PowerPoint\nfor the upcoming presentation.

As a result, I was able to merge my changes into the version\nAnika gave to the instructor, so everything was nicely consolidated. </p>\n\n<p> I brought the merged document, along with a list of remaining questions\nand possible answers, to our group meeting. We spent twenty minutes on that\nbefore we came to any answers. Alex was pretty quiet during most of the\ndiscussion, but after noticing something, he said he thought he had an\nidea. He tried to explain it and, in true Alex form, he didnt do a very\ngood job, but what I did understand seemed to make sense. I think he saw\nthat we werent quite following his explanation, so he asked if he could\ntake it home and work on it for next week. I was hesitant, because he\ndoesnt usually explain his own ideas well, but I said OK. We still have\ntime in case it requires too much cleanup. In fact, everyone was OK with\nit. </p>\n\n<p> We next discussed the presentation &mdash; beginning with the\nPowerPoint Lionel had put together. Before Anika could comment (because she\nalways does), Lionel pointed out that this was just a start; he knew there\nwasnt much to it. He recommended that everyone claim a few slides and\nmodify them when they worked on what they were going to say. At this, Anika\njust shut her mouth. I have to admit, that was pretty satisfying. Shes not\nmean or anything, but it was nice not to hear her being critical for once.\n</p>\n\n<p> I claimed a few slides, including the first one, but Lionel said he\nwanted to introduce us. I was surprised, because I didnt figure hed\nvolunteer for such a visible role. We ultimately decided that we should\nboth give it a shot and see which one we all like best when we practice\nnext week. Im actually excited about making it into a bit of a\ncompetition. </p>\n\n<p> While Im told Im good at it, I really hate public speaking.

It was like he\nwas a completely different person. We all commented on the dramatic\nimprovement. Im not sure he quite believed it, but there was some relief\non his face and I felt better. He was also more active in providing\nfeedback to everyone else. He pointed out that Alex had included something\nthat wasnt actually in our paper. Alex told him where hed found it and\nLionel seemed glad, but not satisfied. He asked if we wanted to talk in the\npresentation about something that we didnt mention in the paper. I dont\nthink it was a big deal because it was true, but he clearly felt like it\nwas a bad idea and he wouldnt let it go. He wasnt telling Alex to take it\nout &mdash; he was asking where we should add it to the paper. He offered\nto make the change, so we said OK. </p>\n\n<p> I practiced some more for the presentation, but mostly I already felt\ngood about that. I instead spent my time on creating new versions of the\nimages for the paper. Lionel must have spent a lot of time thinking about\nthese.

I felt bad for Lionel, though, because\nafter last weeks discussion, Alex had second thoughts and removed the\ncontroversial bit from his presentation, but didnt think to let Lionel\nknow, so Lionel still added it to the paper.

Then Natasha suggested that we try to combine them. That\ndidnt really work, but I think it helped us to see them a bit differently\nbefore we settled into making decisions. Our first vote split evenly down\nthe middle, so Alex made a list of pros and cons. It helped to put things\nin perspective. Our next vote was unanimous. As Alex pointed out, the other\ntopic, although more exciting on the surface, would have probably been much\nmore complicated and difficult. </p>\n\n<p> The obvious next step was to find more materials on our selected topic,\nso we figured out the major subtopics and divided them amongst ourselves.\nWe decided everyone would return next week with summaries of what theyd\nfound to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly.

Lionel emphasized that this was just a\nstart and that he knew there wasnt much in it. He recommended that\neveryone claim a few slides and modify them when they worked on what they\nwere going to say. Natasha spoke for a few slides, including the first one,\nbut this time Lionel said he wanted to introduce us. I was surprised,\nbecause I didnt figure hed volunteer for such a visible role. We\nultimately decided that theyd both give it a shot and see which one wed\nall like best when we practice next week. </p>\n\n<p> I didnt spend too much time on this this week.

Natashas ideas were easily the most fun &mdash;\nwhile Alex and I were suggesting fairly standard things, she managed to\nkeep coming up with interesting perspectives. Not all of them were\nappropriate, but they sure kept the discussion lively, and it didnt take\nmuch to make them useable.  </p>\n\n<p> Anika was quiet. I could tell that she was paying attention, but I\nguess shes a bit shy. When we started to slow down a bit, I realized that\nno one was taking any notes, so we tried to run back through the ideas\nwhile I wrote them down. We talked about the ones we remembered. </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to six ideas. We decided\nto all look for resources on all the topics. We will discuss them and\ndecide on one next week. </p>\n\n<p> During the week, I tried to look for stuff on all six topics, but while\nthey all sounded good during the meeting, only two of them really seem to\nwork for our project. Interestingly, one of the two was one that Im pretty\nsure started with a joke by Natasha. After an hour, I felt well-prepared\nfor those two topics, but I kept looking for stuff on the other topics for\nanother hour to make sure I had something for all the rest. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

Our discussion quickly became about our most promising\ntwo topics. </p>\n\n<p> We had a lot of discussion about which to choose &mdash; everyone had\nan opinion.

The other topic, although more exciting,\nwould have probably been more difficult. </p>\n\n<p> The obvious next step was to find more materials, so we divided up the\nmajor subtopics amongst ourselves.

I cant believe that this\nwas the first time I realized we were presenting our instructor with a\ngreat big wall of text! How could I have missed that? I took the document\nhome and sketched out ideas for four diagrams I felt would help us to\ncommunicate our point. </p>\n\n<p> I got to the meeting late, and everyone was already talking about our\ncomplete lack of images. I apologized and pulled out my sketches, and\neveryones faces lit up. My sketches werent very good, but I think they\nhelped everyone to come up with better ideas. After 30 minutes, Natasha\n(who is a much better artist than I), had three good diagrams to work with.\nShe said shed be happy to build them out and add them to the paper for\nnext week. </p>\n\n<p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation, and\neveryone sounded better this week. Anika even commented that mine had\nimproved dramatically. I noticed a bunch of mistakes, but no one talked\nabout them. Feeling better about the presentation, I was better able to\nlisten to their parts and offer them feedback. I noticed that Alex was\nspeaking too quietly, while Anika was a bit too fast.  </p>\n\n<p> Alex included something that I didnt remember from anywhere in the\npaper. He told me where hed found the information, and I believe him\nbecause hes got a great memory, but I wasnt sure that we wanted to talk\nin the presentation about something that we didnt mention in the paper.\nNatasha and Anika didnt think it was a big deal, but I feel like its a\nbad idea. If its important enough to talk about, shouldnt we write about\nit, too? Isnt this supposed to be a presentation of what weve learned? I\nasked Alex to add it to the paper, but he didnt think it was necessary,\nand neither did Anika or Natasha. I think everyones getting tired and just\nwants to be done with this. Finally, I just said that Id add it into the\npaper myself. </p>\n\n<p> I only spent half an hour making the small addition to our paper and\npracticing this week. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(54,4,12,'<p> The images Natasha put together really added a lot to our paper and I\ncan see them making it easier for people to understand some aspects of it.\nI also claimed one of the images for one of my slides, because it would\nspeak so much better than the bullet points I had on there. I cant believe\nwe didnt have any images in at all until now. </p>\n\n<p> This week the presentation was much better. After another three\npractice runs, it sounded smooth. Alex was consistently speaking loud\nenough to be heard by the audience and wed slowed Anika down. I was a\nlittle bit frustrated to find that, after our argument last week, Alex\nremoved the bit they forced me to add into the paper. Its not as though\nits out of place or that it needed to be in the presentation, but why\ncouldnt he have just gotten rid of it last week when I asked him about it?\n</p>\n\n<p> Natasha added the photos of us to her introduction slide, and I have to\nadmit, her intro was much better than mine. Finally, and arguably most\nimportantly, we managed to cut it down to the correct time. </p>\n\n<p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a\nmoment. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

Anika, on the other hand, raced through her presentation and as\na result, I dont think anyone understood her. We wound up finishing up\nabout 30 seconds early &mdash; I cant imagine thats a good thing.  </p>\n\n<p> Our classmates asked some good questions, which showed that they\nunderstood most of our presentation. Anika, who spoke last, naturally\nreceived all the questions, but she handed them off to whomever she felt\nwas best suited to answer them. There werent a lot of questions, but I got\nto answer two and I felt good about being able to do that in front of our\ninstructor.  </p>\n\n<p> We should have discussed clothes beforehand. I came slacks and a sports\njacket, and Natasha wore a dress skirt and blouse. Alex and Anika were\ndressed very casually, and it was a bit uncomfortable. </p>\n\n<p> Generally, though, I think we felt good about the work wed done. I\nexpect positive feedback and good grades. </p>\n\n<p> We only met briefly this week because we were mostly finished and we\nall had finals to study for, but Alex said that he had time to go through\nit once more.

As we went through it, Anika took\nissue with a few of the changes Alex made.

Alex seemed to have the\nhardest time of it, and he hesitantly volunteered to fix it before\nsubmission, but we could all see that was a bad idea. Anika said she had no\nproblem doing it as long as everyone trusted her, because there wasnt\nenough time for her to make the changes and get us all to say OK in time.\nOf course we all trusted her and said so. </p>\n\n<p> The night before she sent it in to our instructor, Anika sent us a copy\nof the document to make sure we were all OK with it.

(57,5,1,'<p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team\nmeetings. The rest of my group are freshmen and theyre all nervous about\nthis \"huge project\" but, as a sophomore, Ive already done lots of them.\nIts clear that if I dont provide a lot of guidance, Ill wind up writing\neverything myself at the end. </p>\n\n<p> The project looks fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for\nmost of the time. I suggested some that I thought were pretty obvious and\neveryone seemed really impressed, so I told them Id done this sort of\nproject before. Jose tried to be involved, but the two ideas he suggested\nwere pretty mediocre. When Sam spoke, I wasnt sure if he was serious or\nnot. His suggestions were kind of funny, but Im not sure that was his\nintent &mdash; he definitely has a unique approach. Kim mostly just\nlistens; I guess shes shy or maybe just getting comfortable. Everyone\nfocused on trying to improve on my suggestions. </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. I\nrecommended we each look for resources on one topic, report back next time\nand then select a topic, and everyone thought this was a pretty good idea.\nI spoke up for the topic that was most interesting to me &mdash; Id\nalready done some work on it for another class. Sam spoke for another and,\nafter a moment, Jose took another &mdash; but he didnt sound thrilled\nabout it. Kim said shed take the last two, but that seemed like too much\nfor her, so I said Id take it. She surprised me by insisting, so we\ncompromised and split it. She seems nice but hasnt said very much and I\ndont know what to make of her. </p>\n\n<p> The research for this week took me about an hour. Ive got tons of\nmaterials on both topics because I was able to use some materials from the\nother class, as well. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(58,5,2,'<p> We began the meeting by going over the materials wed collected over\nthe last week, and it was very disappointing. Im glad Kim and I split that\nlast topic or the group would have junk for both of hers &mdash; shes\nclearly out of her depth. To be fair, though, it seems that neither Sam nor\nJose did much better. There are some things that we can use, but I can see\nthey barely read any of what they found. As a result, we spent most of the\nmeeting talking about how I conducted my research and vetted the results.\nSam didnt even understand why what he found wasnt useable, until I asked\na few questions about the topic &mdash; things that wed need to know for\nthe paper &mdash; and where he found the answers. Of course, he could only\nanswer one or two of them. I then went to my own notes and answered the\nsame questions for the topics I took, and then he seemed to understand.\n</p>\n\n<p> When I pointed out that they should redo their research for next week,\nSam actually suggested that the group just go with the topic I researched\nsince Id done such a good job with it (again, not sure if he was serious).\nI argued that this is obviously no good, because they still wont have any\nidea how to do the research &mdash; and this might not be the best topic\nfor us, anyway. Ultimately, they agreed and decided to redo the research\nfor next week. </p>\n\n<p> We ended early and Kim stopped me as I was about to leave. She told me\nshe thought I was rude to Sam by laughing at him, and we had an argument. I\nexplained that I wasnt being mean, I was just trying to help everyone get\nthe most out of the class! I wasnt trying to be mean &mdash; I thought he\nwas joking! I told her Id try to be more sensitive in the future, and she\nwas OK with it. </p>\n\n<p> Since my materials were fine, I didnt have anything to do this week,\nbut I did spend about half an hour looking for materials for the other\ntopics to help them out. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(59,5,3,'<p> In this weeks meeting, we sorted through the materials wed got to\nevaluate them and decide on a topic, but it was tough to come to agreement.\nTheyd all brought better materials this week. I feel like I never should\nhave pushed them to redo their research, because Sam came back loving his\ntopic, even though the materials available for it were pretty weak. Even\nworse &mdash; he convinced Kim to agree. I dont know how that happened,\nbecause I pointed out that the materials available were really thin and\nthere really wasnt much on which to base a paper. On the other hand, Jose,\nwho didnt much like his own topic, agreed that the topic Id initially\nselected was the best of them &mdash; its got the best resources\navailable, as well. The discussion went on for most of the scheduled\nmeeting time, and ultimately the group settled on the topic Id researched.\nIm not positive that Sams really on board, but he did say ok. </p>\n\n<p> After the topic was settled, I started drafting our outline and\neveryone joined in. It became clear pretty quickly that Id have to teach\nthem how to structure a paper properly. Even afterward, Sam proposed some\nodd ideas that he said would make it more interesting. I had to explain\nthat, while that was great for fiction, this was needed to be professional.\nAgain, he gave in, but Im not sure that meant he agreed. Jose suggested we\nsplit up the source materials among ourselves, look for a few more, write\nwhat we can about them and bring that back next week. It wasnt a bad idea,\nbut as soon as I started assigning them, everyone got upset with how I was\ndoing it, so I asked them to claim one they wanted until there were none\nleft. This worked pretty well, but Jose took one that was really too\ncomplicated and difficult, so I offered to help with it; this seemed to\nupset him. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about another hour taking notes this week. I took some notes on\nthat piece for Jose, but he never did get in touch with me to work on it,\nso I figured Id bring them to class and give them to him there. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

I dont get it, but he did take them. </p>\n\n<p> Jose and Sam were late to the meeting this week, but thats not such a\nbig deal. What wasnt OK was that Sam forgot to write summaries for two of\nthe five parts he was supposed to bring! No one else seemed to care until I\nreminded them that we only had one week left before we turned it in. Its a\nshame, because he did a great job with what he did write. Jose seems to\nhave completely ignored all the notes I gave him and a quick glance at his\nsummaries shows that he doesnt understand what were doing with this\npaper. Its not garbage, but there is a lot of work left to do. Kim did an\nOK job on her parts, but, while they are OK for next week, they are on the\nshort side and she didnt think about the outline at all or where her\nsummaries might fit into it. Its going to take a lot of work to build this\nout into a paper.  </p>\n\n<p> Naturally, everyone was surprised to see my summaries because they were\nmuch more complete. Also, no one else had thought to include pointers to\nthe sections where they should be used in our outline. Unfortunately, with\nthis due next week, theres no time for them to fix theirs. Sam said hed\nput everything together for what we need to turn in, since he still has to\nwrite a lot of his materials. I told him to send it to me so I could look\nat it before we turn it in. </p>\n\n<p> Next we talked about the outline and Kim had some really good ideas for\nimproving it. Everyone agreed, but Sam complained that it was too much for\nhim to do for next week and asked that we just make a note of it and make\nthe changes later, but this wont get us the feedback we need from the\ninstructor. Anyway, hes the one who didnt do his work for this week...\nKim stepped up, however, and offered to make the changes if Sam could get\nthe rest of it done by the middle of the week. Sam agreed. I really hope I\ncan trust them to do it right. </p>\n\n<p> Before we left, I reminded everyone that we need a completed draft\nready in another four weeks and that they should build out their summaries\nto look more like mine for next week. From the looks on their faces, it\nseemed no one else realized this was necessary, but no one argued. </p>\n\n<p> There wasnt much for me to do this week outside of the meeting, so I\nfocused on my other classwork. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(61,5,5,'<p> Kim was a little late, but turned in our paper in in class. After\nclass, the instructor allowed some time to meet for group work, and we\nreviewed Sam and Kims work &mdash; they explained that they met up in the\nmiddle of last week after Sam had done his part and worked on finishing\neverything up together. There wasnt a lot of time in class and it looked\nok. I pointed to a few problems, but there werent a lot of comments. </p>\n\n<p> Everyone was happy to see the paper starting to take shape and we\ndiscussed what we should do next. Sam suggested that we each build out the\nsummaries wed been working on, but I had to point out that that wouldnt\nwork, because some of them would appear all throughout the paper. I was\nabout to speak, but Jose had arrived and heard us talking about what came\nnext. He said we should just wait for the feedback from our instructor,\nanyway. He argued that we should take the week off, instead! The worst part\nwas that Kim and Sam also thought this was a good idea.  </p>\n\n<p> I had to explain that the first assignment was basically just to make\nsure we were moving forward. I also told them that, in my experience, it\noften took weeks for them to get this sort of thing back to us; if we\nwaited on that, wed never have the draft completed in time. I cant\nbelieve they didnt know! Also, its getting toward mid-term time and well\nappreciate the extra time to study later if we finish most of this now.\n</p>\n\n<p> I told them we have to keep moving to get this done. That meant\nsplitting the paper into four pieces and each of us taking one &mdash; we\ncould save the introduction and conclusion to be written after the rest is\nin place. Eventually they agreed to this. </p>\n\n<p> I took the last quarter of the paper and spent a lot of time working on\nit this week. The topics in this part were mostly done by Sam and Jose, and\nI had to fix many major problems with Joses work. Hes trying, but doesnt\nreally get it. I had to review a bunch of the materials to see what they\nwere really saying and then redo everything. He misinterpreted the\nmaterials and was therefore arguing the wrong point.

(62,5,6,'<p> Sam and Kim were again there when I arrived this week, but Jose was\nnot. We started by looking at Kims work. It was well written and shes\nmade some good observations that I hadnt even thought of. We spent some\ntime exploring those observations further, and it gave me some ideas to add\nto mine. Sams looks fantastic because he included some great visuals that\nmade it easy to understand what he was trying to say &mdash; he should be\nan illustrator. This started us talking about where else we might be able\nto add images to strengthen our paper. We came up with a diagram and a\ngraph that would really help, and Kim volunteered to take the graph, but I\ndont want her to be overloaded since Ill probably ask her to do much of\nthe proofreading and formatting. Plus, Sams obviously good at it. So I\nasked him to do them both, and he seemed happy. </p>\n\n<p> Then Jose showed up, about fifteen minutes late, saying his coach had\nbeen holding the team late to prepare for their upcoming game. We moved on\nto the part of the paper Id rewritten and Jose was angry because he didnt\nunderstand why I changed his part of it. I said that what he had put\ntogether had helped me orient myself, but that Id had to make some changes\nso it would all make sense and work toward the same vision. He responded\nthat it was my vision and not the groups. Then Kim spoke up to say that\neven though the paper is much different from what she thought it would be,\nit was clear that I had a lot of experience and that the paper was turning\nout well. After that, Jose admitted that he was going in a different\ndirection and asked us to think about writing the paper that way &mdash; he\nthought it was valid. So we talked about the problems we might run into\n(not the least of which being that wed have to do a major rewrite).\nUltimately, he gave up and stayed on the same path, of course. Obviously,\nwe didnt look at Joses work because he would have to make some major\nchanges to it, anyway. </p>\n\n<p> Since none of their pieces are really finished and I had some things I\nwanted to add to mine (thanks, Kim!), we decided to each spend another week\nwith our own parts. I volunteered to write the introduction and conclusion,\nas well.

It was only about five minutes this\ntime, but its getting to be a habit and he said the game was last week, so\nI asked him to please try to be on time in the future; he glared at me. He\nreminded me that his coach has been keeping him longer lately and then\nadded that it didnt matter because I was doing the whole project anyway\n&mdash; that it didnt make much difference if he was there or not. How am\nI supposed to respond to that? I reminded him that its a group project and\nthat were all working toward a shared grade on this. Really! Am I supposed\nto apologize for being more experienced? Kim stepped in at this point to\ncalm Jose down. She confirmed, and asked me to confirm that we were working\nas equals on a group project. </p>\n\n<p> Everyones pieces looked much better this week &mdash; especially\nJoses, which was pretty much entirely rewritten. While Sams very good\nwith visuals, his writing skills leave a lot to be desired. At first, I was\nmaking a lot of comments and corrections, but then I gave up and told him\nthat Id take it and fix it for next week. He was fine with that. Everyone\nseemed to be pretty happy with the way the paper was turning out, in fact\n&mdash; even Jose. </p>\n\n<p> I suggested that maybe we might want to trade pieces to proofread for\nnext week and then end early. Nobody was opposed to this, and Id already\nvolunteered to take Sams work. Kim said shed assemble the four pieces for\nnext week so we could see the whole thing together. I wasnt comfortable\nwith this because we would all be looking at our pieces separately this\nweek, and it wasnt fair to make her do all of that. However, she pointed\nout that we could still make our edits to the pieces in the larger paper\nand she was volunteering to make the changes in the final document, too.\nSo, since I couldnt think of any good reason why we shouldnt, we went\nwith it. </p>\n\n<p> Jose asked that we change our meeting time for next week because he has\nsome study sessions to attend. Sam asked if we might even be able to cancel\nit, since weve all got mid-terms coming up and our paper is looking like\nits in pretty good shape; Kim agreed with him. Naturally, no one\nremembered that it was my planning and organization that put us in such a\ngood position. We decided to change next weeks meeting to fifteen minutes\nimmediately after class; it will be primarily to pass around the updated\ndocument and our corrections. </p>\n\n<p> It took me a while to get through Sams work, and I had to rework a lot\nof it.

This\nlead to some lively debate, and it became clear that there were competing\npoints of view within the classroom. </p>\n\n<p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Kim did a good job\nof not only integrating her own work into the paper, but cleaning things up\nin general. She seems to have a real knack for that. She moved some things\naround throughout the paper, and its a real improvement. Shes also\napplied the formatting throughout the document and its looking good. Jose\nand Sam were also impressed. Kim put a lot of work into it. The changes\nmade it difficult, however, to distinguish one piece from the other. We\ndecided we should look through our high-level comments and feedback to see\nwhat still makes sense to incorporate, and then hand the detail work back\nto Kim to apply in the new version. Most of the changes ended up being work\nthat Kim had already done. </p>\n\n<p> Then, Sam brought up the class discussion and asked what we should do\nabout addressing the other viewpoints. While we probably should mention\nthem, Jose looked at this as some sort of vindication of where he was going\noriginally (that I corrected). Worse yet, Sam agreed! Our existing approach\nshowed we are creative and thoughtful, rather than just parrots of the\ntextbooks. When the discussion stretched on, I suggested that maybe we\nshould hold our regularly-scheduled meeting to finish the discussion. No\none wanted to do that. I offered instead to add in a note explaining the\nother perspective, and Sam really liked this idea. He explained that he\nreally likes the direction weve taken the paper, but that he was nervous\nthat wed look like wed completely missed that alternative perspective.\nHes got a really good point, too. This got Jose on board, but he wanted to\nwrite it. I said no way! His other work has been sloppy, and I said I\nwouldnt risk turning in something unfinished, even if it is just a draft.\nKim told him that if he could get it to her by mid-week, shed include it\nin the draft she was preparing. On our way out, I caught Kim and asked her\nto be sure to keep the note brief. </p>\n\n<p> I didnt have anything to do outside of class this week, so I focused\non my other class work. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

Although it integrates\nnicely, I thought that Kim would keep Joses brief note brief; instead, it\nadds almost a full page. </p>\n\n<p> About ten minutes into the meeting, I started to get up and leave\nbecause I was the only one there.

If they do, they probably\nwont see anything. I guess everyone is exhausted. Maybe they hate me? </p>\n\n<p> Our next task was to begin preparing for the presentation. We drafted\nan initial PowerPoint, and they all just accepted the assignments that I\nsuggested &mdash; they pretty much followed the parts of the paper theyd\neach written.

I like that you reached beyond what we did in\nclass.\" The comments clearly favored the results of my guidance (in\ncontrast with the direction Jose was pushing for). Another comment\ncomplimented the images. One of the comments indicated a need to further\ndevelop a section and another asked us to recheck one of our references.\n</p>\n\n<p> Our meeting opened up very strangely, as Jose completely misinterpreted\nthe instructors comment. He thought the instructor was complimenting the\nfact that the document took what we talked about in class a bit further.

He did say hed change it some to make sure its\nstill in line with what everyone else wrote, and I guess this is OK. We do\nhave the note in the paper, so I guess hes got that covered. Sam and Kim\nhad both fixed some parts of theirs, but we spent most of the meeting\nfixing other parts. We also talked about how we should dress for the\npresentation. Kim had an elaborate costume idea that was completely\nunprofessional (and I hate dressing up in costumes). I said business\ncasual. When we ended the meeting, I reminded everyone that our\npresentation is in just two weeks. </p>\n\n<p> Reworking the paper this week took me about two hours, but I didnt\nmind. If I hadnt done it, it probably would have been wrong. Also, the\ninstructor was right about the reference &mdash; Ill have to ask Sam what\nhappened with that and if hes able to track down the correct reference.\nIm glad my part of the presentation is finished now. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

He\nexplained that it was just a placeholder he threw in while he was writing,\nand he never got around to removing it. Its pretty funny that it stayed in\nthis long without anyone noticing. I continued and both of them were fine\nwith my fixes. </p>\n\n<p> Kim arrived just as I finished looking at the changes. She asked to\ntake another look, but I asked her to look at it after the meeting,\ninstead, so that we would have time to practice the presentation again.\nNone of them made many changes &mdash; even Sam, and thats annoying\n&mdash; but the presentation felt much better this week. They must have\npracticed a lot. After two practice runs, it sounded smooth. While its\nstill running too long, we agreed that everyone will probably speak faster\nin class and the instructor probably wont be a stickler on time. </p>\n\n<p> We decided to end early this week. I reminded everyone to wear formal\nbusiness clothes to the presentation next week. </p>\n\n<p> I practiced a few more times this week, but mostly I was free again to\nwork on my other coursework. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

The biggest surprise, though was Sam: he added an analogy at the end\nthat not only tied everything together, but it also made everyone laugh. It\nwas unexpected and risky, but it worked out well.

(71,6,1,'<p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team\nmeetings. I think we got lucky, because Anna is already a sophomore, while\nthe rest of us are freshmen. It seems like she knows what shes doing. </p>\n\n<p> The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for\nthe rest of the time. I suggested some topics, but they werent nearly as\ngood as Annas ideas. I knew they werent that great before I said them,\nbut when I caught a glimpse of Annas face when I said them, I felt dumb.\nShe told us that shes done this sort of thing before. Thankfully,\neverything I said was sort of overshadowed by Sams contribution that no\none knew how to respond to. When he speaks, I cant tell if hes serious or\nnot. His suggestions are kind of funny, but Im not sure thats his intent\n&mdash; he definitely has a unique approach. Kim mostly just listens; I\nguess shes shy or maybe just getting comfortable. Soon, everyone focused\non trying to improve on Annas suggestions.  </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. Anna told\nus we should each look for resources on one topic and then report back next\nweek. She spoke up for a topic shed already worked on in another class.\nSam quickly spoke up for another and, then I chose the most interesting one\nthat was left. Honestly, though, I was disappointed because I liked the one\nAnna chose, but Ill give this a shot. Kim said shed take the last two,\nbut I guess Annas concerned, so she offered to take one herself. Kim\ninsisted, though, that she can handle it, so Anna split it with her. Im\nnervous about Kim, too, because she hasnt said or contributed much, but\nthats fine. Weve got time. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about 45 minutes researching my topic this week and I found a\nlot of materials, so I feel pretty good. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(72,6,2,'<p> We began the meeting by going over the materials we collected over the\nlast week. Anna was clearly disappointed, and she didnt hide it well. She\nspent most of the meeting talking about how she did her research. It was\nhelpful, but makes me feel like Im a child. Im going to have to do a lot\nof it again. Sam asked some questions indicating that he didnt see why his\nmaterials are mostly unusable, and Anna just laughed at him. He asked again\nand this time Anna responded with a few detailed questions that Sam\ncouldnt answer. She then went to her own notes to answer the same\nquestions. It seemed a bit cruel (and Im glad it wasnt me) because I\ncouldnt have answered those questions. Sure, they are important and all,\nbut were new to this and shes not. Shes already worked on this topic\nbefore. </p>\n\n<p> I suggested that, in the interest of time, maybe we just go with the\ntopic she worked on, but Anna insisted that we redo our work. She pointed\nout that we all need to be able to do the research. No one could argue with\nthat, so we said wed redo our work. </p>\n\n<p> The next night, I spent about another hour and a half finding and\nskimming through new materials. I was still able to use most of my original\nmaterials. I found a bunch of additional ones, too. I dont love this\ntopic, though, so it feels like a waste of time. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(73,6,3,'<p> During this weeks meeting, we sorted through the materials to decide\non a topic; we have much better materials this week. It turns out that\nSams topic is really cool, but it was clear Anna was more interested in\nher own topic. So was I. Its really got the most potential, and weve got\nthe best resources for it. We went back and forth for most of the meeting\nand it was a pretty good debate, but in the end, I thought Annas topic was\nbest, and Kim wound up agreeing with us (even though she started out siding\nwith Sam). After Kim changed her mind, Sam agreed to go along. </p>\n\n<p> After the topic was settled, there wasnt much time, but Anna jumped\nright into drafting an outline, and she wouldnt let anyone else help. Sam\nhad some interesting ideas about how to make the paper easier to read, but\nwhen he brought them up, Anna took it as a sign that none of us had ever\nwritten a research paper before. We all had to sit through her explaining\nto us what an outline is and why we use it &mdash; thats ten minutes of my\nlife wasted. No one made any comments on the outline after that. </p>\n\n<p> When I suggested that we each take a few of our sources, search for\nmore content on our own and then write up summaries for next week, Anna\nagreed and started assigning them out. She acted like she was the only one\nwith a brain, however, and she didnt trust the rest of us to get anything\nright, so she took the materials that were actually interesting and offered\nany depth &mdash; strange, since she made such a big deal out of making\nsure we were all \"learning\" during the initial research. I wasnt the only\none upset &mdash; Kim spoke up first to request a specific topic, and then\nSam and I did the same. This clearly irritated Anna, but eventually she\ngave in and we each claimed the ones we most wanted. This seemed fine and I\ntook one that I thought I could make into something interesting, but\napparently Anna didnt think I could handle it. She told me shed \"help\" me\nwith it &mdash; like Im incompetent or something. I just said OK and moved\non &mdash; she can do what she wants, but Im writing it. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about two hours on reading, searching and writing summaries.

(74,6,4,'<p> After class this week, Anna handed me her \"help\" &mdash; her completed\nsummary was even longer than mine! Does she think Im not competent to\nwrite anything? I wasnt sure how to respond; I just kept thinking this\ncouldnt really be happening, but when I realized it was, I took the paper\nand walked away. When I got home, I found that shed pulled out completely\ndifferent main points. I can see that this is where shes going, but my\napproach is just as good, and I didnt have time to make any changes to\nwhat Id written, anyway. </p>\n\n<p> I was a bit late to the meeting, but it was only about five minutes and\nSam was just arriving when I walked in. I can tell that Anna wasnt\nthrilled with what I brought, but she was more upset that Sam didnt finish\nhis part. She was particularly upset because she thought we were writing\nour completed portions to be added directly into the paper &mdash; and\napparently no one else thought this. What does she expect? She tells\neveryone what to do because shes got more experience, but then she doesnt\nexplain what she means &mdash; assuming that we have the same experience\nthat she does. Kim called her out on this, asking why she wrote so much\nalready when were so early in the project. After all, we only have the\npreliminary structure done, and this is only the fourth week of class.\n</p>\n\n<p> Anna got upset and asked how she would be able to put anything together\nusing materials as thin as this; thats when Sam spoke up. He made a joke\nabout how poorly hed done his part &mdash; his wasnt just thin, it was\nnonexistent. It wasnt that funny, really, but everyone laughed and he\nvolunteered to assemble next weeks assignment since he still has pieces to\nwrite. He also suggested that we take a look at what weve got and whether\nthe outline we put together still fits. It was really either that or fight\nfor another hour, so everyone was all for it. </p>\n\n<p> The discussion was OK, and Kim offered some really good ideas about how\nto sequence things. It helped me to see the paper differently, and it gave\nme some more ideas. Anna agreed that the sequence is a good idea, but Sam\nquickly pointed out that he wouldnt have time to do it all, and Anna\nstarted getting upset again. I also dont have time to help out;\nfortunately, Kim offered to make the changes if Sam could get the rest of\nit done by the middle of the week. Sam gladly accepted this, and they\ndecided to coordinate later. </p>\n\n<p> Naturally, before we left, Anna had to remind everyone that we need to\nkeep working on our summaries because weve got the draft due in another\nfour weeks. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about half an hour on my sections this week, but I mostly\nfocused on my other classes. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),
(75,6,5,'<p> Kim had our assignment ready and turned it in during class. The\ninstructor allowed some time at the end of class this week, so we reviewed\nwhat she and Sam put together.

Anna was pleased with their work, so the\nmeeting went pretty smoothly. </p>\n\n<p> My coach kept us late all week to prepare for a home game against our\nrivals in two weeks, so I was about twenty minutes late. It was a tough\npractice and I was exhausted, so when I arrived and the group was\ndiscussing our next steps, I suggested we take a break from it for a week\nwhile we wait for feedback from the instructor. Sam and Kim seemed to think\nthis was a pretty good idea, but Anna got upset. She spent the next ten\nminutes explaining that she thought the instructor probably would barely\nlook at our papers, much less provide meaningful feedback. She said itd\nprobably be weeks before we got it back; by that point, wed have no time\nleft to get our draft together. She kept talking about how we couldnt stop\nnow because of midterms, scheduling and all sorts of other junk. I gave up\nbecause I just didnt want to hear any more. I really could have used a\nbreak, but I guess she wont let us have one. </p>\n\n<p> We split the paper up into quarters and each took a section to write up\nfor next week. Before we left, I told everyone that Id probably be late\nthe next week because of our practices. </p>\n\n<p> I had to spend about two and a half hours writing my part of the paper\nthis week. I mostly had to work with Sams contribution and just a bit of\nKims. Sams contributions were difficult to understand. He had some good\npoints, but the way he wrote was very confusing and took a long time to\nunderstand &mdash; sometimes it was easier to just go back to the sources.\nThey also seemed to miss part of the point.

(76,6,6,'<p> I was a little late again for our meeting this week because of\npractice. Before I arrived, the group went through Kims and Sams work. I\ndidnt really get a chance to read either of them, but Sam included visuals\nin his and it makes a big difference! I guess that they all agreed and\nlooked for places to add more. </p>\n\n<p> Next, we reviewed Annas. She sort of apologized to me for changing it\nto make sure it all made sense and worked toward the same point. As I read,\nthough, it became clear that she rewrote almost everything I gave her. I\nrecognize it, of course &mdash; its all very similar to the \"help\" she\ngave me. I completely wasted my time and might as well not have written\nanything!  </p>\n\n<p> I answered that it was her vision and not that of the group. Kim spoke\nup and took Annas side, saying she liked where the paper was going. I\nrealized that it didnt matter what I said or did, because we were just\nhelping Anna write her paper. It wasnt a bad paper, but it wasnt ours\neither. It was clear that Id have to rewrite most of the work Id done\nthis week, so we didnt bother looking at mine. </p>\n\n<p> As it turned out, I didnt have as many changes to make as I thought.\nIt only took me about 45 minutes to fix it all up. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:27','2017-03-02 08:22:27',NULL),

She made Anna confirm (out loud) that we are\nall equals, working on this project together. Of course, Anna had to remind\neveryone that she had more experience than anyone else, but Kim pushed us\non anyway. </p>\n\n<p> Anna was happy with everyones work this week &mdash; especially mine.\nOf course, Im basically just doing exactly what she told me. She was\ndisappointed by Sams work, and there are a lot of corrections to be made\nthere, but its nothing at all like last week. Anna told him shed take it\nand rewrite it for next week. At this, Anna told us we needed to trade\npieces and proofread each others work for next week. Everyone was OK with\nthis, but Kim wanted to get started on assembling the paper and volunteered\nto do that. Anna pointed out that it would be tough to match the individual\npieces with the assembled document so that we could make the changes, Kim\nsaid shed take care of it, so it was decided. </p>\n\n<p> As we were getting ready to go, I asked if anyone would mind changing\nour meeting time for next week &mdash; I had a study session to prepare for\none of my midterms.

Anna decided that we should\nstill meet, but only briefly immediately after class to share our changes.\n</p>\n\n<p> I took Kims piece and it was really in pretty good shape.

Sam, although usually pretty quiet during class, even got in on\nthe discussion and made a few good observations, although Im not sure\neveryone really understood them. I landed in a pretty smart group. </p>\n\n<p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Kim did a great\njob on the paper again, and Sams diagrams were mostly spot on. One of them\nseemed odd, but I couldnt explain why. Fortunately, Anna understood and\nasked Sam to make a few changes in line with my comments. Sam said he\nwasnt a good enough artist, however. He said that he agreed with me and\nthat hed like to be able to do it, but he doesnt have the skill. I cant\nreally argue with that, can I? Even like this, the diagrams really help to\nspruce things up and I didnt want to spend that much time on them, anyway\n&mdash; I was much more interested in the class discussion. Since Kim had\ndone such a great job, most of our own comments and changes werent\nrelevant any longer, so we mostly just handed them to her to incorporate\nfor next week. </p>\n\n<p> When I wanted to talk about fixing our paper because the class was\ninterested in what I wanted to say, Anna said it was boring and that she\ndidnt have time to explain all the problems with it and asked if we wanted\nto hold our regular meeting to discuss it. Of course, we couldnt do this\nbecause we all had other study sessions to go to, but Sam also wanted to\ninclude my perspective. Finally, Anna gave in and agreed to add a section\non it, but she wouldnt let me to write it &mdash; like Id screw it up or\nsomething! She said that she didnt want us turning in something that was\n\"sloppy\" &mdash; my work is not sloppy!

She spoke up for the topic she explained more clearly than me, and I\nquickly spoke up for another one I liked. After a few moments, Jose took\nanother. Kim said shed take the last two, but I guess Annas concerned, so\nshe offered to take one herself. However, Kim insisted that she could\nhandle it, and eventually Anna split it with her. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about 30 minutes researching my topic this week and I think\nwere off to a good start, so I feel pretty good. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(86,7,2,'<p> We began the meeting by going over the materials we collected over the\nlast week. Anna was clearly disappointed, but I didnt understand what the\nproblem was. This was only the second week and we were just trying to\nnarrow down the topic.  </p>\n\n<p> Anna laughed and started asking questions about the materials Id\nfound. They were very in-depth questions, and its not as though we needed\nto know all of that now. However, she argued that we would need to know the\nanswers to evaluate the topics effectively, and she could answer those\nquestions for hers. I didnt agree with her, but I didnt want to fight\nabout it, so I said I did. </p>\n\n<p> Jose suggested that, in the interest of time, maybe we just go with the\ntopic she worked on, but Anna insisted told us that we had to redo our\nwork. She pointed out that we all need to be able to do the research\n&mdash; and maybe one of the other topics would be better for our group.\nShes going to be a pain in the neck. We all agreed with her and said wed\nredo our work. </p>\n\n<p> The next night, I spent about another hour and a half on finding and\nskimming through new materials. Most of my materials were still fine, but I\nread more of them and now I can defend them. I found some extras, as well.\nIm really liking this topic and Im becoming convinced that this is the\none to go with. Theres lots of material on it and its just plain\ninteresting! </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(87,7,3,'<p> During this weeks meeting, we sorted through the materials weve got\nto evaluate to decide on a topic and we have much better materials this\nweek. I really like the topic I researched, but Anna is pushing for the one\nshe took initially. I tried to explain how we could touch on so many\ndifferent areas with mine, but thats exactly why Anna doesnt like it\n&mdash; she thinks that we wouldnt be able to focus ourselves. Kim seemed\nto understand what Im saying and agreed with me, but Jose supported Anna.\nWe went back and forth for most of the meeting and really it was a pretty\ngood discussion, but in the end, Anna won Kim over.  </p>\n\n<p> After the topic was settled, there wasnt much time left, but Anna\njumped right into drafting an outline, and she wouldnt let anyone else\nhelp. I suggested something Ive used before to try to make the paper\neasier to read, but Anna didnt like it and wanted to go with a more\nconventional approach. She figured that we just didnt know how to write a\npaper, so she spent about ten minutes explaining to us what an outline is\nand why we use it. No one made any comments on the outline after that. </p>\n\n<p> Jose suggested that we each take a few of our sources, search for more\non our own and then write up summaries for next week so were ready for the\nfirst assignment. Anna agreed and started assigning them out. However, she\ndid it like shed decided that she was the only one with a brain and she\ndidnt trust any of the rest of us to get anything right, so she took all\nthe materials that were actually interesting and offered any depth &mdash;\nstrange, since she made such a big deal out of making sure we were all\n\"learning\" during the initial research. I wasnt the only one upset &mdash;\nKim spoke up first to request a specific topic and then Jose and I joined\nin. This clearly irritated Anna, but eventually she gave in and we each\nclaimed the ones we most wanted. She still couldnt let go, though, and\nwhen Jose claimed one that she wanted, she told him shed \"help\" him with\nit because it was very complex. He wasnt happy about that. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about an hour reading, searching and getting started on the\nsummaries one night this week, but figured Id do the rest next week. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(88,7,4,'<p> I made a mistake. I forgot to finish my summaries until about half an\nhour before our meeting. Not only was I late to the meeting as a result,\nbut I didnt have time to finish, either. Jose was just arriving when I\nwalked in and Anna got upset with us both for being late, but then she was\neven more upset when we shared our work. Anna wasnt sure who to be more\nupset with: me or Jose. Kims work was OK, but Joses were a bit on the\nbrief side. However, after she got through my first three summaries, there\nwas no hiding the fact that Id forgot two of them. I apologized and\nexplained that Id had a lot to do for my other classes. Both Kim and Jose\nunderstood, but Anna just couldnt let it go. </p>\n\n<p> Then she showed us her pieces which went way beyond \"summary\" and\nlooked like completed portions to be added directly into the paper. She\nasked why we didnt all include pointers to where the summaries should\nultimately fit in the paper like she did. Kim argued with her on this. She\nasked why Annas written so much already when were so early in the\nproject. After all, we only have the preliminary structure done and this is\nonly the fourth week of class. Anna got upset and asked how anyone would be\nable to put anything together using materials as thin as this.  </p>\n\n<p> Thats when I spoke up. I tried to lighten the mood by pointing out\nthat mine wasnt just thin, it was nonexistent, and everyone laughed. It\nwasnt that funny, really, but I think we needed it. I also volunteered to\nassemble next weeks assignment, since I still had pieces to do. Finally, I\ntried to move us on by suggesting that we take a look at what wed got and\nwhether or not the outline we put together still fits. The truth is I was\njust trying to get Anna to move beyond the poor quality of everyones work.\n</p>\n\n<p> The discussion was OK, and Kim offered some really good ideas about how\nto sequence things. I thought they were good ideas, but we really didnt\nhave time to put them together. There was just no way I could get all of\nthat done in the next week. However, Anna really liked the idea and started\ngetting upset with me for not having time. I know I screwed up this week,\nbut does she want me to mess up again next week? Fortunately, Kim stepped\nup and offered to make the changes if I could get the rest of it done by\nthe middle of the week. I accepted this and we decided to figure out the\ndetails after the meeting. </p>\n\n<p> Naturally, before we left, Anna had to remind everyone that we need to\nkeep working on our summaries because weve got the draft due in another\nfour weeks. </p>\n\n<p> After the meeting, Kim asked me to let her know when I was done with my\npart and when I did, she suggested that we meet at the library the next\nevening. We got to talking about the project and other classes. Although\nshes quiet, she seems to notice everything. She even pointed out that she\nliked how my topic idea was turning out &mdash; she noticed that I was\nreally the first one to suggest our topic! </p>\n\n<p> Anyway, we both had time, so we sat down to work together on the\nrevisions and it was so easy to work with her. At one point, though, she\nblocked what I thought was a good idea, asking if I thought I could\nconvince Anna to go along with it. Its annoying, but she was right. We\nfinished the writing much quicker than Id expected &mdash; maybe an hour\nor so.  </p>\n\n<p> All told, I think I spent about two and a half hours on this outside of\nour weekly meeting. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(89,7,5,'<p> Kim had our assignment ready and turned it in during class. The\ninstructor allowed some time at the end of class this week, so we all\nreviewed what she and I put together. Anna was pleased with what wed done,\nso the meeting went pretty smoothly. </p>\n\n<p> Kim and I arrived a couple of minutes early for our meeting and we were\njoking, but then Anna showed up and we got down to business. After working\nwith Kim last week, I really see how the paper is taking shape. I suggested\nthat maybe we further build out our summaries into the paper. Anna just\nlooked at me like I was dumb and said that we had to break it up into\nquarters because each of the summaries would be represented in multiple\nplaces in our outline. I thought we werent quite ready to start on the\nactual paper yet, but I couldnt explain that and shed already decided,\nanyway.  </p>\n\n<p> Thats when Jose showed up and said we should take the week off! He\nargued that we had to wait for the instructors feedback. Kim and I\njokingly encouraged him, but I dont think he thought it was a joke. Im\npretty sure Anna didnt, either, because she got very upset and spent the\nnext ten minutes explaining that the instructor probably would barely look\nat our papers, much less provide meaningful feedback. She pointed out that\nitd probably be weeks before we got anything back and by that point wed\nhave no time left to get our draft together. She kept on about how we\ncouldnt stop now because wed want to take a break later during midterms.\nShe was right about all of it, of course, but Jose was really disappointed.\nHe said hed be late next week either way because of practice. </p>\n\n<p> We split the paper up into quarters and each took a section to write up\nfor next week. </p>\n\n<p> My section was supported by some of my own summaries, as well as a lot\nof Annas work and some of Kims. I have to admit that Annas a good\nwriter. She really made it easy for me to put things together with her\nnotes and pointers. She provided a nearly-complete set of instructions for\nme to follow in building out the paper. Its like shes known exactly how\nthis paper would look from the very beginning.  </p>\n\n<p> I had some ideas for diagrams that would help to make some things\nclearer, so I went ahead and drafted them. I spent a lot of time on this\nbecause I sort of get absorbed in trying to make my art perfect. As a\nresult, I probably spent about two and a half hours on everything together.\n</p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(90,7,6,'<p> Kim and I arrived at around the same time for the meeting this week.\nAnna got there a few minutes later and we reviewed our work. Kim had done\nwell with her piece and we spent a long time talking about some of her\nobservations and what they could mean in other parts of the paper. My\nwriting is nowhere near as good, but Anna was distracted by the images I\nincluded. I have to admit that Im pretty proud of them. We spent some time\nlooking through Annas and Kims pieces, trying to come up with visuals\nthere, too. Kim said that shed add a chart using some of her data, but\nAnna told me to do it.  </p>\n\n<p> At first I was happy because I had fun with them, but Kim responded\nthat she hadnt done a lot of that sort of thing before and wanted to try\nit even if she then handed it to me to clean up. I thought it was a good\nidea, but Anna seemed not to hear it. She said I should do it because Im\ngood at it &mdash; but it didnt feel like a compliment. It feels like\nthats all Im good for. I thought it should all be shared around, anyway?\nHow else is everyone going to learn? </p>\n\n<p> Then Jose arrived and he reminded us that his team was preparing for\ntheir upcoming game and hed be late for the next couple of weeks as a\nresult. I think hes here on a sports scholarship. Anyway, he was very\nupset when we looked at Annas changes to his work. I didnt see what he\ngave her, so Im not sure, but he said she ripped out or rewrote most of it\nand I believe it. Shes always telling everyone what to do (hes right) and\nshe clearly doesnt think much of him or his work. Anna said she was just\ntrying to make sure the paper looks and feels consistent.  </p>\n\n<p> This time, Jose wasnt backing down, though, and they probably would\nhave argued for the rest of the meeting, but Kim spoke up. She commented\nthat even though the paper is much different from what she thought it would\nbe, it was turning out well. Jose asked us to at least consider including\nthe perspective that Anna ripped out, but Anna tore the idea apart as too\nconventional and obvious. She said that we would wind up with just another\nboring paper that anyone could write and that wed have to spend a huge\namount of time rewriting the paper that way &mdash; she asked if Jose\nwanted to do a complete rewrite for next week. At this, Jose gave up and we\ndecided to keep the paper as shed written it. We didnt bother looking at\nJoses work for this week because he would have to make some major changes\nto it, anyway. </p>\n\n<p> I enjoyed working on images again this week and they all look even\nbetter now. The team offered good suggestions, but also I had some more\nideas. I really like doing this kind of work. With that and the substantial\ncleanup I needed to do to the written portion, I probably spent almost\nanother hour and a half this week. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(91,7,7,'<p> Jose was a little late again when he arrived this week, but this time\nhe was visibly limping. Im not sure if Anna thought he was faking it or\nwhat, but she asked him to \"please try to be on time in the future\" in an\noverly polite tone. This set Jose off and he sniped back that it didnt\nmatter since she was obviously writing the whole thing herself however she\nwanted. Kim spoke up to calm them both down. She even made everyone,\nincluding Anna, confirm (out loud) that we are all equals, working on this\nproject together. Of course, Anna had to remind us that she had more\nexperience than anyone else, but Kim pushed us on anyway. </p>\n\n<p> Anna was clearly disappointed with my work this week, but it wasnt too\nbad and the images were good. We decided to swap papers with each other to\nproofread them; and she took mine. Everyone was OK with this, but Kim\nwanted to get started on assembling the paper and volunteered to do that,\nas well. At first, Anna said no because it would be tough to match the\nindividual pieces with the assembled document so that we could make the\nchanges, but Kim said shed take care of it. </p>\n\n<p> As we were getting ready to go, Jose asked if anyone would mind\nchanging our meeting time for next week &mdash; he has a study session to\nprepare for one of his midterms. I thought that was a great idea I because\nalso have midterms coming &mdash; I suggested that we cancel it, since the\npaper is in pretty good shape. Naturally, Anna said no. She said we should\nstill meet, but that we can do it briefly, immediately after class to share\nour changes. </p>\n\n<p> I took Annas piece and so there wasnt much to clean up (shed\nprobably change it all back, even if I had).

(92,7,8,'<p> During this weeks class, some of the discussion touched on the topic\nof our paper and it felt good to be so well prepared. There was some good\ndebate about the competing points of view and Jose spoke up a lot. I made a\nfew comments, but, as usual, they didnt quite come out right. I could see\nthat no one seemed to quite understand what I was saying. Im not good at\nthat sort of thing. </p>\n\n<p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Kim did a great\njob on the document again; she made a lot of changes on my portion. Jose\npointed out a problem in with part of my piece, but I didnt get it until\nAnna got impatient and told me Id forgot one of the diagrams. I had to\nexplain that Id actually spent about half an hour on it and couldnt make\nit work. Im not actually trained as an illustrator or an artist or\nanything. They were all disappointed, but naturally, Anna just told me to\ntry harder. I said Id try again, but honestly, I dont what more to do.\n</p>\n\n<p> I asked about our in-class discussion and how we wanted to address that\nin the paper. After all, it was clear that there were multiple points of\nview and we should at least acknowledge them. Anna said those approaches\nwere boring and that she wasnt going to throw away a good paper &mdash;\npointing out that our existing approach showed that we are both creative\nand thoughtful.  </p>\n\n<p> I agreed with Anna in general, but I pointed out that we need to at\nleast acknowledge the in-class conversation. Anna gave in a little bit and\nallowed a brief section, but didnt want Jose to write it because she was\nnervous that his work wasnt very good and we wouldnt have time to clean\nit up by the time the draft is due next week. Jose was offended by this,\nbut Kim told Anna shed review it if Jose could get it to her quickly and\nAnna was OK with that. So Kim asked him to get it to her by mid-week. Jose\naccepted this. </p>\n\n<p> I spent another half an hour on trying to rework the diagram, but Im\nsure its not what Anna wants. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(93,7,9,'<p> Kim had our paper ready to be submitted when she arrived in class, and\nshe also brought a copy for each of us to review. I had to leave right\nafter class, but I took a look that evening and it looked good to me. </p>\n\n<p> Later in the week, Jose and I got to talking after a class we share,\nand he told me that this weeks meeting would start about ten minutes late.\nUnfortunately, it seems that no one mentioned this to Anna. She was getting\nready to leave when we arrived. Shes usually very serious, but this week\nshe seemed to be even more uptight and stressed &mdash; she was probably\nreally angry. </p>\n\n<p> Anna had a long list of changes to the paper and some of them were\npretty big, but no one said anything &mdash; I know I felt guilty and I\nimagine everyone else did, too. She told us all to take another look at the\nwhole paper and read it straight through for next week to make sure we\nhavent missed anything and no one argued. </p>\n\n<p> Our next task was to begin preparing for the presentation. Anna drafted\na PowerPoint for us to use and then assigned slides to each of us. At one\npoint, she asked if anyone was upset with their piece and I think everyone\nwas afraid to make her mad, so she kept going. Then she told us we needed\nto write up our talking points for each of our slides and to practice a few\ntimes in front of a mirror for next week &mdash; like were all children\nwho have never presented anything before. </p>\n\n<p> I think the images do a pretty good job of communicating the main\nideas, so I used some of them as the basis for my slides.

She didnt like that at all and\nasked if he was trying to make the presentation better or make her feel\nbad. He shut up after that.  </p>\n\n<p> Even after three practice runs together, everyone took home a list of\nthings to work on to fix their presentations. Kims was probably the best\nof all, but she spoke very quietly to her notes in her own hands, rather\nthan to the audience. </p>\n\n<p> I actually spent an hour and a half reworking my part &mdash; and then\nabout half an hour more practicing it (in front of a mirror). </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(95,7,11,'<p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups and our team\nmet briefly during class to review it. The instructor left only six\ncomments in our paper, and most of them were pretty small, but one\ncomplimented my images. The only other one that seemed significant asked us\nto further develop a section. </p>\n\n<p> Our meeting opened with another fight between Anna and Jose. Jose\ninterpreted one of the comments to mean that he should write more in the\nsection about alternative perspectives, and Anna disagreed. Anna talked\ndown to him a lot and told him why he couldnt be right, and that just kept\nmaking him angrier, but it was clear that he couldnt win. I didnt want\nhim to win either, because it would mean rewriting the whole paper. Jose\nfinally gave up, and Anna said shed make the changes the instructor\nrequested this week. </p>\n\n<p> The presentations were better this week, but we still need more\npractice and rework. Anna had improved upon her presentation significantly\nsince last week. I dont know how she did it, but it sounded perfect.  </p>\n\n<p> We also talked about how we should dress for the presentation. Kim had\na cool costume idea that was in line with our topic that Jose and I both\nliked, but Anna said it was unprofessional. She said we had to wear\nbusiness attire so we would look professional. When we ended the meeting,\nAnna reminded everyone that our presentation is in just two weeks. </p>\n\n<p> I had a few small changes to make and did a few practice runs this\nweek, but probably not more than 45 minutes. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),

Ive got to be honest, I am\namazed that the instructor noticed it. I explained that it was just a\nplaceholder I threw in while he was writing.  </p>\n\n<p> Kim arrived just as Anna finished looking at the changes. Kim asked us\nto take another look, but Anna told her to look at it after the meeting,\ninstead. Although it didnt seem like anyone made many changes, the\npresentation felt much better this week.

It doesnt seem like hes showing off or anything, he just thinks a\nlot about the words he uses.

Im pretty sure that one of Sams\nsuggestions was a joke and one of them I couldnt understand at all, but\none of them was a really good idea. No one seemed to understand any of\nthem, and I didnt want to say anything. Later, I was surprised when Anna\nsuggested the same thing as though it was brand new. I dont think she was\ntrying to steal credit or anything, I just think she didnt understand him.\nAnyway, its a good idea. </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. Anna told\nus we should each look for resources on one topic and then report back next\nweek. She spoke up for a topic shed already worked on in another class and\nSam quickly spoke up for another. Jose eventually took another one and I\nsaid Id take the two that were left. Anna didnt like that and said shed\ntake one of them, but I put my foot down &mdash; shes not going to walk\nall over me.

Im going to have to\ndo a lot of it again. Sam asked some questions indicating that he didnt\nsee why his materials are mostly unusable, and Anna just laughed at him.\nHes braver than I am, though, because he asked again. Anna responded with\na few detailed questions that Sam couldnt answer. She then went to her own\nnotes to answer the same questions. It seemed cruel, and Im glad it wasnt\nme because I couldnt have answered those same questions. Sure, they are\nimportant, but were new to this and shes already worked on this topic\nbefore. </p>\n\n<p> Jose suggested that, in the interest of time, maybe we just go with the\ntopic she worked on, but Anna insisted that we had to redo our work.

Sam and Jose also agreed with it. </p>\n\n<p> After the meeting, I pulled Anna aside and told her that she was out of\nline in being so rude to Sam. It was uncalled for and I just couldnt stand\nby and let her do it. She pled innocent, though.

Its a pretty good one, and its also clear that she will not\ngive up. </p>\n\n<p> After the topic was settled, there wasnt much time left, but Anna\njumped right into drafting an outline and she wouldnt let anyone else\nhelp. Sam suggested something to make the paper easier to read, but Anna\ndidnt like it and wanted to go with a more conventional approach. She\nfigured that we just didnt know how to write a paper, so she spent about\nten minutes explaining to us what an outline is and why we use it. No one\nmade any comments on the outline after that. </p>\n\n<p> Jose suggested that we each take a few of our sources, search for more\non our own and then write up summaries for next week, so were ready for\nthe first assignment. Anna agreed and started assigning them out. However,\nshe acted like she was the only one with a brain and didnt trust any of\nthe rest of us to get anything right She took all the materials that were\nactually interesting and offered any depth &mdash; strange since she made\nsuch a big deal out of making sure we were all \"learning\" during the\ninitial research. This was not OK, so I told her which topics Id take. Sam\nand Jose backed me up by making their own preferences known.  </p>\n\n<p> We spent time negotiating who took what, but it was much better than\nher assignments. This clearly irritated Anna, but with everyone\ndisagreeing, there wasnt much she could do. She couldnt let go entirely,\nthough, and when Jose claimed one that she wanted, she told him shed\n\"help\" him with it because it was very complex &mdash; does she not see how\ninsulting that is? </p>\n\n<p> I spent about an hour and a half on reading, searching and getting\nwriting my summaries this week. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(102,8,4,'<p> Jose and Sam were a bit late to the meeting. Anna was visibly upset,\nbut she didnt say anything about it. Sam explained that he forgot to\nfinish two of the five parts he was working on, and I thought she was going\nto explode. I dont see why this was such a big deal since weve still got\ntime before even the first assignment. After we took a look at everyones\nwork, she couldnt contain herself any longer and asked why no one had done\ntheir work. She compared what we brought to what she brought. Shes got\nwhat looks like completed portions to be added directly into the paper.\n</p>\n\n<p> I told her to give it a rest &mdash; we still have time and no one was\nslacking off, but she got upset and asked how I would be able to put\nanything together using materials as thin as this. Thats when Sam spoke\nup. He made a joke about how poorly hed done with his part &mdash; his\nwasnt just thin, it was nonexistent. It wasnt actually funny, but\neveryone laughed, and he volunteered to assemble next weeks assignment\nsince he still has pieces to do. He also suggested that we take a look at\nwhat weve got and whether the outline we put together still fits. It was\nreally either that or fight for an hour, so everyone is all for it. </p>\n\n<p> I had some new ideas about how to sequence the paper Anna particularly\nliked one idea, but Sam pointed out that he wouldnt have time to do it\nall, and she started getting upset again. I offered to make the changes if\nSam could get the rest of it done by the middle of the week. Sam gladly\naccepted this and we decided to coordinate later.  </p>\n\n<p> Naturally, before we left, Anna had to remind everyone that we need to\nkeep working on our summaries because weve got the draft due in another\nfour weeks. </p>\n\n<p> After the meeting, I asked Sam to let me know when he was done with his\npart. When he was done, I suggested that we meet at the library the next\nevening. We got to talking about the project and I pointed out that I knew\nour topic was his idea first. I think he really appreciated that. We worked\ntogether on the revisions and it went smoothly, with me doing most of the\nwriting. There was only one time we disagreed and that was just because I\ndidnt think we could make Anna go along with Sams idea. Its just not\nworth fighting with her. We finished the writing quicker than I expected\n&mdash; maybe an hour or so.  </p>\n\n<p> The day after I met with Sam, I cleaned everything up and put it all\ntogether for submission. All told, I think I spent about two hours on this\noutside of our weekly meeting. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(103,8,5,'<p> I turned in our assignment in class and the instructor allowed us some\ngroup time at the end of class, so we all reviewed what Sam and I put\ntogether. Anna was particularly pleased with what wed done, so the meeting\nwent well. </p>\n\n<p> Sam and I arrived a couple of minutes early for our meeting and we were\njoking a bit, but then Anna showed up and we got down to business. Sam was\nreally getting excited about the paper, and he suggested that we further\nbuild out our summaries into the paper. Anna looked at him like he was dumb\nand told him (like it was obvious) that each of the summaries would fit in\nmultiple places in our outline. He looked confused &mdash; like he wasnt\nquite sure what he was trying to say, but thats when Jose showed up and\njoked that maybe we should take the week off! He argued that we had to wait\nfor the instructors feedback, anyway. I thought it was funny, so I\nencouraged him, but then I realized he didnt think it was a joke. Of\ncourse we would have to keep working if we wanted to get everything done in\ntime.  </p>\n\n<p> Anna took both of us seriously and got upset. She spent the next ten\nminutes explaining that the instructor probably would barely look at our\npapers, much less provide meaningful feedback. She pointed out that itd\nprobably be weeks before we got anything back at all and by that point wed\nhave no time left to get our draft together. She also made the point that\nif we kept going, we might be in a good place to break later during\nmidterms. Jose was disappointed and said hed be late next week either way\nbecause of practice. </p>\n\n<p> We split the paper into quarters, and we each took a section to write\nup for next week. </p>\n\n<p> My section was supported by some of my own summaries, as well as a lot\nof Annas work and I have to admit that Annas a good writer; she made it\neasy for me to put things together with her notes and pointers.

(104,8,6,'<p> Again, Sam and I arrived at around the same time for the meeting this\nweek. Anna arrived a few minutes later, and we reviewed our work. We spent\na long time talking about some of my observations and what they could mean\nin other parts of the paper. Anna was distracted from Sams poor writing\nskills by his impressive artistry. This pushed us to spend some time\nlooking through Annas and my pieces to try to come up with good visuals\nthere, too. I volunteered to add a chart of some of my data, but Anna said\nno, because she wanted Sam to do it. I havent really done that kind of\nwork, and I wanted to give it a shot, but Anna still wouldnt let me. She\nwants me to do the proofreading because she thinks Im really good at it\n(even if it is boring), and she doesnt want me to be overworked. Its not\nworth fighting about it. Therell be other projects... </p>\n\n<p> When Jose arrived, he reminded us that his team is preparing for their\nupcoming game and hell be late for the next couple of weeks. He was very\nupset when we looked at Annas work because I guess she changed a lot of\nwhat he wrote. I didnt see what he gave her, so Im not sure, but he said\nthat he feels like Annas ignoring or ripping out the work of everyone who\ndoesnt do what she wants (true). He pointed out that shes always telling\neveryone what to do (hes right). Anna said she was just trying to make\nsure the paper feels unified in its vision.  </p>\n\n<p> They probably would have argued for the rest of the meeting, but I\nfigure that since Annas part of our team, were going to have to work with\nher. Shes got good ideas, so I pointed out that even though the paper is\nmuch different from what Id thought it would be, it was turning out well.\nJose asked us to at least consider including the perspective that Anna\nripped out. Anna said no, because we would end up with just another boring\npaper that anyone could write; wed have to spend a huge amount of time\nrewriting the paper that way. She asked if Jose wanted to do a complete\nrewrite for next week. At this, Jose gave up and we decided to keep the\npaper as shed written it. We didnt look at Joses work because he would\nhave to make some major changes to it. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about half an hour cleaning up my part a little more, but that\nwas about all for this week. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(105,8,7,'<p> Jose was late again when he arrived this week, but this time he was\nvisibly limping. Im not sure if Anna thought he was faking it, but she\nrudely told him to \"please try to be on time in the future.\" Naturally,\nthis set Jose off, and he shot back that it didnt matter since she was\nbasically writing the whole thing herself. Seeing that this was going\nnowhere, I tried to calm everyone down. I reminded everyone that were all\nequals working on this project together, and I even made Jose and Anna both\nsay so out loud. Of course, that wont make any difference to Anna, but it\nmade Jose feel better. </p>\n\n<p> After reviewing each others work, we decided to swap papers to\nproofread them. I took Joses, but I also wanted to get started on\nassembling the paper, so I also volunteered to do that. Anna said no at\nfirst, because she thought I couldnt handle matching up everyones\nproofreads with the assembled paper, but I promised that Id reassemble it\nnext week if I couldnt match things up. I felt uncomfortable that we still\nhadnt seen all the pieces together. </p>\n\n<p> As we were getting ready to leave, Jose asked if anyone would mind\nchanging our meeting time for next week &mdash; he had a study session to\nprepare for one of his midterms. I also have midterms to study for and Sam\nsuggested that we cancel the meeting, since the paper is in pretty good\nshape. Naturally, Anna said no. She said we should still meet, but that we\ncould do it briefly, immediately after class to share our changes. </p>\n\n<p> I proofread everyones papers as I was putting them together into the\nfinal paper this week. It took me about two hours, and I had to move a\nbunch of things around, but it made me feel better to know that we were\nalmost ready to turn this thing in. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(106,8,8,'<p> During this weeks class some of the discussion touched on the topic of\nour paper; both Jose and Sam spoke up during the discussion. There was some\ngood debate about the competing points of view. Sams comments made sense\nto me because I know him at this point, but he doesnt explain himself\nwell, and Im not sure it made sense to anyone else. </p>\n\n<p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Everyone was\nexcited to see the full paper. Jose and Anna pointed out a problem with one\nof the images and asked Sam to fix it, but he said he couldnt. Anna was\ndisappointed, but Sam said hed already tried to fix it and it always came\nout worse instead of better. Finally he said hed give it another try, and\nthat was enough to let us move on. </p>\n\n<p> Sam asked about our in-class discussion and how we wanted to address\nthat in the paper. It was clear that there were multiple points of view,\nand we should at least acknowledge them. Anna listened for a bit but soon\ngot tired of it and told Jose that would make the paper boring. Compared\nwith what weve got, shes kind of right.  </p>\n\n<p> Sam pointed out that we need to at least acknowledge the in-class\nconversation, and Jose jumped on this, volunteering to add a section about\nit. Anna agreed, but didnt want Jose to write it because I guess she\ndoesnt trust him to make it look good enough to turn in next week. I said\nId review it when Jose got it to me and then integrate it. Anna was OK\nwith that. I asked Jose to get it to me by mid-week. Anna caught me on the\nway out and told me to make sure to keep the new section brief. </p>\n\n<p> Jose got the new section to me late in the week, but there was still\nplenty of time for me to put everything together for class.

(107,8,9,'<p> In addition to the copy to be turned in, I brought copies of our draft\nfor each of us to review. I couldnt stay after class to discuss it,\nthough, and I guess no one met, anyway. This was going to be a busy week\nfor me with an unexpected project dropped on me in another class.  </p>\n\n<p> Later in the week, Jose thanked me during the week for putting the\npaper together, and it really made my day. I told him that Id be a little\nlate to the meeting because of this other project I had to work on; he said\nhed let the others know. When I arrived, I learned that Jose told Sam but\n\"forgot\" to tell Anna. She sat in the meeting alone with no idea what was\ngoing on. That was a pretty awful thing to do and, although she tried to\nhide it, Anna was definitely hurt. I felt terrible. </p>\n\n<p> Anna had a long list of changes to the paper and some of them were\npretty big, but no one said anything &mdash; I know I felt guilty. I\nimagine everyone else was, too. She asked us to take another look at the\nwhole paper, and read it straight through for next week to make sure we\nhavent missed anything. </p>\n\n<p> Our next task was to prepare for the presentation. Anna drafted a\nPowerPoint for us to use and then assigned slides to each of us. At one\npoint, she asked if anyone was upset with their piece and no one was, so\nshe kept going. Then she told us we needed to write up our talking points\nfor each of our slides and to practice a few times for next week. </p>\n\n<p> I had a lot to cover in my portion, so it took me awhile to put\ntogether a set of notes. I spent a lot of time practicing it and reworking\nit to try to make sure it fit the time allowed and to make sure it felt\nlike it flowed properly.

I like Jose, but he seemed to\nbe almost happy to be able to criticize her for a change, and that was\ndisturbing.

(109,8,11,'<p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups and we met\nbriefly during class to review it. The instructor left only six comments in\nour paper, and most of them were pretty small, but one asked us to further\ndevelop a section. </p>\n\n<p> Our meeting started with another fight between Anna and Jose. Jose\ninterpreted one of the comments to mean that he should write more in the\nsection about alternative perspectives, and Anna, predictably, disagreed.\nAnna talked down to him a lot, and that just kept making him angrier, but\nit was clear that he wasnt getting anywhere. It would mean rewriting the\nwhole paper and no one wanted that. Ultimately, Jose gave up and Anna said\nshed make the changes the instructor requested this week. </p>\n\n<p> The presentations were better this week, but we still need more\npractice and a bunch of rework. Jose changed his part in response to what\nhe thought the instructor was saying, but he said hed change it to make\nsure it was still in line with what everyone else wrote.

I thought it would be a great\nidea to have costumes in keeping with our topic and both Jose and Sam liked\nthat, but Anna said it would make us look like children.

Iain\nattacked back, saying that the low quality of her work made it very\ndifficult to work with. That wasnt fair, and I started to defend Marie for\nat least working and trying hard, and showing up, when Hannah raised her\nvoice and everyone quieted down.

Unfortunately, while we already knew there were lots of problems\nwith that version, the instructor left only five comments in our paper. I\nguess they expected much of it to change since it was only a draft, after\nall. One said \"this shows promise,\" two corrected grammar issues in\nsentences that were already gone, and one requested that page numbers be\nadded. The only thing valuable for me was a request to clarify one of the\nsections I wrote. The instructor said it was a \"novel approach\" and that it\nshould therefore be explained more clearly and thoroughly. It was nice to\nknow Id made an impression and that someone who counts got it! </p>\n\n<p> During the weekly group meeting, we were all on time. The discussion\nbegan with how little feedback we got and whether this means the paper was\nin great shape or that instructor simply didnt really read the whole\nthing. Im pretty sure its the latter. Either way, I had the feedback wed\nbeen waiting for and it was time to move forward. </p>\n\n<p> I asked Iain to please review my section again and he responded that he\nalready did that once. I told him itd be nice if he would actually read it\nthis time; maybe that wasnt the best approach, because it turned into a\nshouting match, but Im upset that he didnt do his job in the first place,\nand I said that, too. I was trying to tell him that I really wanted his\nfeedback, but he got upset and snapped back that it was difficult to read\nmy work because it was so bad. I was too embarrassed to respond, but\nthankfully John jumped in and defended me (sort of), pointing out that at\nleast I showed up and tried hard. Hannah raised her voice and everyone\nquieted down. She focused us back on the presentation coming in two weeks\nand the fact that we hadnt practiced for it yet. Iain reluctantly agreed\nto take a look at my section again for next week but made sure to tell us\nhe was too busy to go through the whole thing. </p>\n\n<p> The rest of the meeting was spent working through the presentation. The\ngroup used the PowerPoint I put together in a practice run. We made a few\nchanges as we went, but Id made a pretty good start.

He also\nhad lots of suggestions for the rest of us, but they were a bit hard to\nhear after the argument we just had. The presentation was running too long\n&mdash; particularly Johns part.

John tried hard to be involved, but only suggested a couple\nof ideas and they were pretty mediocre. When Marie spoke, I sometimes\nwasnt sure if she was serious or not. Her suggestions were often funny,\nbut I was too nervous to laugh &mdash; especially since no one else did.\nShe definitely has a unique approach. Mostly, I just took it all in. Soon,\nwe were building on each others suggestions (mostly Iains). </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to three ideas. Marie\nrecommended we each look for resources on one topic, report back next time\nand then select a topic. This seemed like a good plan; Iain spoke first to\nclaim a topic based upon a prior interest and John spoke up for another.\nAfter a moment, Marie took the last topic, but she didnt sound thrilled\nabout it &mdash; I think it sounds like a tough one. I was left without a\ntopic, so I volunteered to search for additional materials on Iains topic\nbecause it sounded the most promising. </p>\n\n<p> After spending half an hour searching, I wasnt able to find much of\nanything.

He also seems to\nhave much more experience than the rest of us do because, although he\nstarted with the same searches I did, he dug into the materials further to\nfind related content.

Its not that the\nmaterials themselves were bad or anything, but he doesnt seem to have\nconnected all the dots when writing them up. He was embarrassed and told us\nhed rewrite them to make them clearer.

Honestly, she seems to need\nhelp understanding what were doing, and everyone is afraid to tell her so.\nAfter some awkward moments, Iain asked a few direct but fair questions. As\nMarie tried to answer, it seemed that she was finally realizing that what\nshe brought was really weak. He didnt push too hard though &mdash;\nprobably didnt want to make her feel stupid.

Marie\nalmost seemed scared when the team reviewed her work, but I was actually\nimpressed with how much she seems to have improved. Maybe that showed on my\nface; after she looked at me, she seemed to relax. John and I pointed out a\nnumber of rough spots, but I was no longer as nervous about her ability,\nand she was visibly relieved. Then it was my turn. I explained that my work\nwas still incomplete, and it clearly was, but Marie said that, given the\ncircumstances, even this much was great to have. We didnt spend much time\non mine. Johns writing was excellent this time. His thoughts were well\narticulated and he covered all the points he was supposed to &mdash; he\nmust be putting a lot of time into this class.

When Marie spoke, I couldnt tell if\nshe was serious or not. Her suggestions were funny, but Im not sure that\nwas her intent. She definitely has a unique approach. Hannah didnt talk\nmuch. She seemed to be paying attention, but I guess shes shy. Pretty\nsoon, everyone built on my suggestions. </p>\n\n<p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to three ideas. Marie\nrecommended we each look for resources on one topic and then report back\nnext time. It seemed like a good idea and everyone else agreed. I spoke up\nquickly for a topic that Ive done some work on it in another class &mdash;\nit was also the most interesting. John spoke up for another and, after a\nmoment, Marie took the last topic. She didnt sound thrilled about it,\nthough. That left Hannah without a topic, so she said shed search for\nadditional materials on my topic. She seems nice, but well see where that\ngoes. </p>\n\n<p> The research for this week didnt take very long because I was able to\nuse some materials from that previous class. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(156,12,2,'<p> Hannah had a breakdown when she arrived because she couldnt find much\n&mdash; shes clearly out of her depth. I pointed out that Id got more\nthan enough to start with and I offered to work with her after the meeting\nto give her some tips and tricks. </p>\n\n<p> After reviewing the topics and the materials everyone found, there was\nfighting over which topic to focus on. Marie decided to start organizing\nthings into lists of pros and cons to make it easier to understand, and\nthen the group held a vote. For some reason, the three of them decided to\ngo with the topic John had researched &mdash; even though my topic would be\nmuch easier and isnt boring. This makes no sense at all and this whole\nprojects going to be a nightmare. </p>\n\n<p> The obvious next step was to find more materials, so we divided up the\nmajor subtopics. We decided everyone would return next week with summaries\nof what theyd found to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly.\n</p>\n\n<p> I met with Hannah two days later and shes nice and pretty bright. I\nshowed her how to pull more keywords out of materials and to look in the\nbibliographies for more ideas. After about two and a half hours, we had\nsome solid references. She went through them and wrote summaries, and then\nI verified them. She was probably just overwhelmed at first, because she\ndid a pretty good job. Now shes on the right track. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(157,12,3,'<p> In this weeks meeting, we began sorting through the materials.\nTogether, Hannah and I had easily the best materials and summaries, and we\ndidnt spend much time reviewing it. Johns materials, on the other hand,\nwere difficult to understand and his help was required to interpret what he\nmeant. He seemed embarrassed and told us hed rewrite the summaries to make\nthem clearer. Maries summaries were interesting and some of them were\nfunny, but I wasnt sure how they fit in. I tried not to look too confused,\nbut everyone seemed unsure of how to respond. After some awkward moments, I\nasked her a few direct questions that seemed to help her see what we need.\nThe team decided there was still plenty of time, though, and that she could\ntake another week to try again. After all, John would be doing the same.\n</p>\n\n<p> I got to relax this week without any tasks for this project. Looks like\nthis project isnt going to take too much of my time after all. Thats\ngreat, because Ive got a heavy course load this semester. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:28','2017-03-02 08:22:28',NULL),
(158,12,4,'<p> I arrived a little late to the meeting, but Hannah wasnt there at all.\nShe wasnt even in class and no one had heard anything from her. The\ninstructor would tell us if she dropped the class, right? </p>\n\n<p> When it looked like she wouldnt be coming, we began working through\nMaries updated materials. John and I exchanged concerned looks. After a\nfew more discussions that were reminiscent of last week, I began pushing to\nmove on and John was happy to join that effort. Marie went with it, even\nthough she was clearly confused. Much less time was needed for Johns\nmaterials because they were in much better shape now. John volunteered to\nput together what we had for the assignment due next week, and we both\npushed to get started on an early draft. We split up the tasks of\nsynthesizing the sections. </p>\n\n<p> I caught John outside after the meeting ended, and we discussed Marie\nand Hannah. We discussed the possibility of talking to the instructor, but\ndecided to wait another week or so. I think we can probably use some of\nMaries resources. John volunteered to proofread her summaries and I said\nId look for additional content. </p>\n\n<p> My searching was pretty easy, and I only needed to spend about half an\nhour on both that and summarizing what Id found. For the first draft of my\nportion of the paper, I spent about an hour writing &mdash; there will be\nplenty of time to fix it up later, and I have other classwork. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),
(159,12,5,'<p> John turned in our assignment during class, and our instructor gave us\nsome time in class to meet. We discussed our progress, but none of us\nexpected to have this time, so no one brought their materials to review. No\none seemed to want to be there, so we all left early instead. </p>\n\n<p> Hannah was back this week and wearing a cast. She slipped on some ice\nand landed in the hospital for a week. Impressively, she brought a first\ndraft of the section that was assigned to her when she was out &mdash; John\nemailed meeting notes to the whole group. </p>\n\n<p> Maries constant attempts to be weird are really getting on my nerves.\nAlso, for some reason, everyone seemed to treat this first draft like it\nwas supposed to be the final complete version; everyone was visibly\ndisappointed with what I brought, but thats fine. Theres lots of time\nleft. Marie was clearly nervous when we reviewed her work, but I was\nactually pleasantly surprised by what shed done. Maybe that showed on\neveryones faces because when she looked up at us, she seemed to relax.\nJohn and Hannah both pointed out a number of rough spots, but Im no longer\nnervous about her ability and she seemed to be visibly relieved. Hannah\nexplained that her own work was incomplete, and it clearly was, but she was\nin the hospital. The fact that she brought anything at all was awesome. I\nhonestly didnt pay too much attention to Johns piece because I figured it\nwas probably pretty good. I started thinking about an upcoming quiz in one\nof my more advanced classes. I tried to focus and participate, but they\ndidnt really need me there. </p>\n\n<p> Marie suggested we hand off our portion to another team member for a\nmore thorough review, even though I didnt think we were ready for that\nyet. John immediately volunteered to take mine, so I claimed his &mdash; it\nwas in pretty good shape already and thatd give me some extra time to\nstudy for my other classes. Hannah asked for more time to finish her\nsection and then Marie specifically asked me to review hers; she took\nJohns. I probably should be flattered, but Id really rather have the time\ninstead. </p>\n\n<p> Marie took some notes on her work before we traded papers, so that made\nit pretty quick and easy to make those changes. I quickly read through the\nwhole thing and found that it was kind of a mess. I set it aside so I could\nspend more time on it later in the week when my other work was done. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),
(160,12,6,'<p> The morning of our meeting, I picked up Maries paper again but I just\ncouldnt manage to get through it. It seems that she tried hard to be\ndifferent and come up with a unique perspective, but the end result doesnt\ncover the main points and really doesnt make any sense. Just as I was\nstarting to make some sense of what she wrote, my brother asked me to come\nover. Hes been having a rough time since his discharge and he told me he\nneeded to get out. I emailed the team to let them know I had to take care\nof a family thing, sent them what I had and then I drove back home to see\nhim. </p>\n\n<p> I had a massive headache the next morning, but I knew itd go away and\nmy brother seemed better. Marie had emailed me to let me know they decided\nto cut the next meeting down to only half an hour to give everyone time to\nprepare for mid-terms in other classes. A good idea, but Id have to really\nrush to make it for a short meeting because one of my own study groups was\nset to end when this one starts &mdash; across campus. As a bonus, though,\nMaries paper was out of my hands. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),
(161,12,7,'<p> I arrived late because of the study group and Hannah asked if\neverything was OK. I explained that something came up with my brother but\nthat he was OK and they gave me a copy of the assembled document &mdash; it\nseems theyre further along than I thought! Were all supposed to review\nthe whole document for next week. </p>\n\n<p> The paper looked pretty good, actually. It seems that Hannah put it\ntogether well and even identified a new section that will need to be\nwritten, as well as a few other changes here and there. They were good\nideas, but the new section will certainly have to wait for the final\nversion, because theres no way we can get it written and added into the\ndraft due in two weeks. All told, I probably spent about half an hour going\nthrough this version and I didnt have many comments. I didnt spend too\nmuch time on Maries work, either. I just didnt have the energy. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),
(162,12,8,'<p> I arrived early this week. Theyve been making decent progress without\nme though, so its not a problem. This time John arrived late because his\nexam had run late. </p>\n\n<p> Marie has a great eye for detail, as she found a ton of spelling and\nformatting errors that everyone else missed. Hannah volunteered to take\neveryone elses copies and make all the changes for the draft that we are\nto turn in next week in class. John pointed out the sections that are still\nmissing or incomplete, but I said its too late to get it into the draft\nand that it should be fine to include a note that it will be in the final\nversion. I certainly didnt have the time to write it. The rest of the\ngroup disagreed with me, though. They decided to try to get it done, and\nMarie volunteered to draft the two sections and get them to Hannah by the\nmiddle of the week so Hannah could incorporate the changes. I couldnt\nimagine how they can find the time, but I offered Marie some suggestions on\nhow to approach the new content, and everyone seemed to value my\nrecommendations. </p>\n\n<p> Fortunately, I managed to get away with no work for this group this\nweek because my other classes are keeping me very busy. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),
(163,12,9,'<p> Hannah brought our paper to class and turned it in to the instructor.\nNow we get to wait for feedback while we continue to work. </p>\n\n<p> John and Marie met last week and worked together; while working through\nit, they noticed a bunch of problems in the draft that will need\ncorrecting. Many of them were in Maries work, and she got upset that I\ndidnt fix them when she asked me to look at it. Why didnt she write it\nlike that in the first place? Eventually, we moved on when Marie suggested\nwe add some diagrams to illustrate some of our points. Even though I had to\ngo to another meeting, I stuck around a bit while the group sketched some\nideas. However, I really did have to go and when they seemed to have it\nunder control, I left. </p>\n\n<p> Again, I was lucky not to have much to do in this class this week. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),

She also asked me to prepare notes or a\nscript for my part in the presentation so we can practice together next\nweek.  </p>\n\n<p> The images were odd, but I sort of liked them.  </p>\n\n<p> Preparing for my part took less than half an hour, so I took some extra\ntime and practiced it on a friend. </p>\n','2017-03-02 08:22:29','2017-03-02 08:22:29',NULL),
(165,12,11,'<p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts and our team met briefly\nduring class to review it. Unfortunately, while we knew there were lots of\nproblems with that version, the instructor left only five comments in the\npaper. I guess they expected much of it to change since it was only a\ndraft. One read \"this shows promise,\" two corrected grammar issues, one\nrequested that page numbers be added and one suggested clarifying some of\nMaries work. It read that it was a novel approach and that it should\ntherefore be explained more clearly and thoroughly. </p>\n\n<p> During the meeting, we were all on time and the discussion began with\nhow little feedback the group got &mdash; we figured that the instructor\nprobably didnt really read the whole thing. Either way, we had our\nfeedback and it was time to move forward. </p>\n\n<p> Predictably, Marie asked me once again to review her section. This\nannoyed me because I really dont want to look at it again. Marie pushed\nwith a snarky tone that shed like me to \"actually read it this time.\" Soon\nshe was accusing me of not participating. Maybe I was out of line, but I\nresponded that the low quality of her contribution made it very difficult\nto work with. John jumped in on Maries side and then Hannah raised her\nvoice and quieted everyone down. She reminded us of the presentation coming\nin two weeks and that yelling at each other wouldnt help us get prepared.\nI said Id look at Maries section again for next week. </p>\n\n<p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation. We\nused a PowerPoint Marie put together in a practice run. We had to change it\na bit, but it was nice to have something there to work with. I think my\nsection is pretty good and offered a few suggestions for everyone else.\nEven after three rounds of practice and changes, the presentation ran too\nlong &mdash; particularly Johns part. I suspect hes not very experienced\nat this sort of thing, because he tried to include way too much and said it\nway too fast. However, we still have time. </p>\n\n<p> I spent about an hour and a half working on Maries section during the\nweek. Unfortunately, it really would have been better to get to this\nearlier because my recommendations will mean changes throughout the paper,\nand I didnt have time to make them all this past week.

Fortunately, Hannah\nvolunteered to make the changes this week, if someone else would promise to\nread through it next week to make sure she didnt miss anything. After a\npause, John volunteered. Good that they stepped up because I dont have\ntime for any of this. </p>\n\n<p> This week the presentation was much better and it sounded smooth.
